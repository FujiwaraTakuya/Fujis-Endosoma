## Actions
Action Economy:
- Standard Action - Allows you to do something, commonly an attack of spell; can also be used as a 2nd Move Action. These Actions include:
-Attacking
-Casting
-Dismissing a Spell
- Move Action - Allows a player to move up to their speed or perform an Action that takes a similar amount of time.
  If you have a BAB of +1 or higher, you can draw or ready a weapon or shield while moving; with the Two-Weapon Fighting Feat, you draw 2 Light or One-Handed Weapons instead of 1.
- Full-Round Action - Consumes all Actions up to perform a time and energy-consuming task.
- Free Action - Actions that consume very little time and effort; there aren't many limits to what and how many free actions a player can do, but GM discretion is advised. These Actions include:
-Speaking
-Dropping Weapon
-Dropping Prone
-Ceasing Spell Concentration
-
- Swift Action - Usage of a small amount of time but larger expenditure of effort and energy; you only get 1 per-turn.
- Immediate Action - Are like Swift Actions and use your Swift Action if not already used to perform any time in or outside of your turn.
- Not an Action - Actions that don't take much effort to pull off like knocking an arrow and 5ft steps; 5ft steps can be made at any point during your turn as long as you use your Move Action for anything else but Movement.
- Restricted Activity - In certain situations, you can't take a full round's worth of Actions; in certain cases, being restricted to only making a single Standard or Move Action (plus Free and Swift Actions). You can't take Full-Round Actions (unless you start or complete a FR Action by using a Standard Action)

Total Defence - You get a +4 Dodge Bonus to your AC for 1 Round; costs 1 Standard Action and improves your AC immediately at the start of this Action; can't be combined with Fighting Defensively of Combat Expertise, and you can't make AoO while in Total Defence.

Withdraw Action - Use your FR Action to double Movement and make the first square of Movement not provoke AoO, but each square after can. If used while only able to use a Standard Action, you can use this Action only up to your Movement.

Surprise Round - Can only perform Standard or Move Actions during, including Free Actions, but not Reactions (Not an Action).


## Movement
Moving through a Square - You can move through allied squares unless your performing a Charge attack.

If you walk through an allied space while in an enemy's Threat Range, the ally does not provide you with cover and you're at risk for AoO.

You can't move through enemy spaces unless they're in the Helpless Condition, but particularly large creatures may cause Movement penalties (GM Discretion). This can be ignored with the overrun or Acrobatics Maneuver.

Fine, Diminutive, or Tiny creatures can move into or through an occupied square whilst provoking AoO when doing so.

A creature of Small or larer can move through a creature's space that are 3 size categories larger than itself.

You can't end a space with another creature unless they're Helpless.

Any creature that fully fills the square it occupies can't be moved past, even with the Acrobatics skill or similar abilities.

Terrain and Obstacles - from tangled plants to broken stones, there are a number of terrains and obstacles that affect your movement
- Difficult Terrain - Areas like heavy undergrowth, broken ground, or steep stairs hamper Movement, requiring 10ft of Movement normally and 15ft moving diagonally; you can't run or charge either.
- Obstacles - Are like difficult terrain but they increase the Movement needed to enter the square by +10ft; this applies to each obstructed square. Flying/Incorporeal creatures can move around or through this without penalties.
- Squeezing - Any creature can squeeze through a space that is half as wide as their normal space, taking a -4 penalty on Attack rolls and AC. A creature can squeeze past a creature while moving, but can't end their Movement in the occupied square; if the space is less than half of your space's width, you must use the Escape Artist Skill; you can't Attack while using Escape Artist to squeeze through a space, taking a -4 penalty to AC and losing any Dexterity Bonus to AC.

Accidentally ending Movement in an illegal space - If you end Movement in an illegal space, move back to the last legal space moved in, or move to the closest legal position if it's closer.

Double Movement Cost -  If Movement is hampered, Movement costs are usually doubled.

Minimum Movement - Despite whatever penalties you might have, you can take a FR Action to move 5ft in any direction, even diagonally, but not through impassable terrain or when Movement is prohibited; this specific Movement provokes AoO (Not a 5ft step).

## Cover & Concealment
Cover - To check for cover from Ranged Attacks, Aim from a corner of your square. If a line from the chosen corner to any corner of the target square passses through something that would provide cover, then it has cover (+4 to their AC).

For Melee Attacks against adjacent targets aims from any corner to a target's square and hits a wall, they have cover. If using a reach weapon and not attacking adjacently, use the rules for Ranged Attacks on Cover.

When gaining Cover from a low obstacles, the Defender must be equally-distant or closer to the obstacle than their Attacker to gain a Cover bonus, whilst an Attacker closer to the obstacle than the Defender negates the Cover Bonus. 

You can't make AoO against a creature with Cover relative to you.

Cover gives you +2 to your Reflex against Burst effects.

Soft Cover is provided from creatures rather than objects, providing no bonus to Reflex saves, not does it allow you to make Stealth checks.

Big creatures choose a square that it occupies to see if an opponent has cover against Melee Attacks and vice versa.

Partial Cover - Can provide cover but more than half the creature is visible, reducing the Cover bonus to +2 AC and +1 on Reflex. This is subject to the GM's discretion.

Total Cover - If you don't have a line of effect to your target (draw a line from your square to theirs without crossing a solid barrier), they're considered to have Total Cover and can't have an attack made against them.

Improved Cover - In some cases, such as attacking behind an arrowslit, cover may provide a greater bonus to AC and Reflex; in such situations bonuses for Cover are doubled. Further more, it provides +10 on Stealth Checks.

Concealment - To determine if a target has concealment from Ranged Attacks, see rules for Cover. For Melee Attacks, this only applies if your target is entirely within an effect that grants concealment. Attacks against creatures with Concealment have a 20% to miss.

Total Concealment - You can't attack a target directly because you can't see them, but you can attack in a general space you believe they might be in, and if it were to hit, the Attack would have a 50% change to miss instead of 20%; you also can't make AoO against an opponent with Total Concealment.


## Special Attacks
Aid Another - Used to help an ally attack or defend against an enemy by being in a position where you can make a Melee Attack of AC 10 as a Standard Action. In succession, your friend gains either a +2 bonus to their next Attack roll against the opponent or +2 AC against the opponent's next attack (your choice).

You can also use this Action to help a friend when affected by a spell or assisting another's Skill Check.

Charge - FR Actions where you move up to twice your Speed and Attack during the Action but must follow the following conditions:
- You must move at least 10ft towards a designated opponent, and if you move only up to your Speed or less, you can also draw a weapon during the charge if you have a BAB of at least +1
- You must have a clear path towards your opponent and nothing can hinder your Movement; you must move to the closest space where which you can attack your opponent; if this space is occupied or otherwise blocked, you can't charge; if this Attack where to pass through any square that blocks/slows movement, or even contains another creature (including ally), you can't charge unless it's a Helpless creature. If you don't have line-of-sight, you can't perform a charge, you can't perform a charge with a 5ft step, and if you can only perform a Standard Action  on your turn, you can still charge, but only up to your Speed (Instead of double) and can't draw a weapon unless you possess the Quick Draw feat.

Combat Maneuvers - Combat Maneuvers can be performed in replacement for an Attack Action, part of a Full-Attack Action, or AoO, with others requiring specific Action; if the target is immobilized, unconscious, or otherwise incapacitated, your maneuver automatically succeeds; if they're stunned you receive a +4 bonus on the roll against it.

Bull Rush - Used as a Standard Action or part of a Charge in place of the Melee Attack. Can only Bull Rush an opponent no more than one size category larger than you. This Action pushes an opponent straight back up to their Movement without doing any harm, but without Improved Bull Rush, provokes AoO from the Target of the Maneuver.

You can't Bull Rush a target through a wall or into an Object; if there's another creature in the way of the Bull Rush, you must make another Bull Rush attempt at -4 to push them as well as the original target; this applies to every enemy within the range of the Bull Rush until the Bull Rush fails or until you stop pushing forwards.

Disarm - You disarm an opponent in place of a Melee Attack, provoking an AoO if you don't have Improved Disarm or a similar ability; disarming while unarmed imposes a -4 on the attack. If you succeed, the target drops 1 item of your choice (even while 2-handed); if this exceeds by 10 over their CMD, both items in the target's hand are dropped; if the attack fails by 10 or more, you drop the weapon being used for the Disarm; if you disarm the opponent without using a weapon, you may automatically pick up the dropped item.

Grapple - As a Standard action, you grapple a foe, provoking AoO without Improved Grapple, and take -4 if grappling with 1 hand or no free hands. This puts both you and a target in Grapple; to maintain the hold, you must make a grapple check as a Standard Action or release as a Free Action; if your target fails a check to escape, you get a +5 bonus on grapple checks on subsequent rounds. When using the Grapple Check to maintain a Grapple, you can also use one of the following Actions as a part of the Grapple Check:
- Move - You can move both yourself and a Target up to half your speed; at the end of Movement, you can move a Target into any square adjacent to you; if you attempt to place the target in a hazardous location, your target gets a +4 bonus to break free.
- Damage - You deal damage equal to your unarmed strike, natural attack, or attack made with armor spikes or a light or a one-handed weapon, lethal or non-lethal.
- Pin - You can give you or opponent the Pinned Condition; despite pinning your opponent, you still only suffer the Grappled Condition whilst losing your Dex bonus to AC.
- Tie Up - If your target is pinned, restrained, or unconscious, you can use rope to tie them up like the pin effect but with a DC of 20 + your CMB instead of CMD. If this Action is used while Grappling, the CM is made at -10. If the DC to escape from these bindings is higher than 20 + the CMB of the target, they can't escape from the bonds, even with a natural 20.

Sunder - Make a Combat Maneuver Check to attack an opponent's item or armour with a Melee Attack; can be used during an AoO and can target potions and scrolls as well. This deals damage to the item, but you can optionally choose to leave the item at 1HP to prevent it from breaking, but even if the item is Destroyed, the item can be fixed using the Make Whole spell.

Trip - Used in place of a Melee Attack, you trip enemies no bigger than one size category larger than you; if you fail the test by 10 or more, you trip yourself; if the target has more than two legs, the DC increases by +2 for each additional leg it has, with some creatures being unable to be tripped.

Feint - With a Standard Action, you use your Bluff skill check against an opponent; if successful, your next Melee Attack made against them hits their flat-footed AC; the attack must be made on this or your next turn. When used against non-humanoids you take a -4 penalty, creatures of 1 or 2 intelligence you take -8, and any creature with no intelligence score is impossible to feint. With Improved Feint feat, you can attempt Feint as a Move Action.

Delay - You choose to wait until you want to perform an Action during that combat round later in the Initiative; doing so will allow you to act before or after an ally or enemy within the initiative, but lower your initiative to later within a round for the rest of combat. This Action can't be used to interrupt another character's Action unlike the Ready Action, but this Action can be used to delay your Initiative into the next Round to increase your Initiative to the top of the initiative list.

Ready - Using a Standard Action, allows you to take an Action later during the Round after your turn is over but before your next one has begun in an attempt to interrupt someone else's Action; this can use a Free, Swift, Move, or Standard Action. This Action will always occur just before the action that triggers it, but assuming the target is still capable of performing their Action, they're able to continue their Action once you've completed your Readied Action. After this, your Initiative is changed to just after the Target of your Readied Action. You're allowed to take a 5ft step as part of a readied action, but only if you haven't moved any distance during the round.
You can Ready an Attack against a spellcaster with the trigger 'if they start casting a spell', with the damage possibly causing them to lose the spell they were casting.
You can Ready a counterspell against a spellcaster akin to readying an Attack; when a spellcaster starts casting a spell, you get a chance to identify it with a Spellcraft check (DC 15+ Spell Lvl), and if you do, and you can cast the same spell (spontaneous or prepared), you can counterspell the target and automatically ruin their spell; this works with even Divine and other arcane magics.
You can use the Ready action to brace yourself against an enemy readying to Charge; any weapon being used against a Charging Target deals double damage to them.

## Non-Magical Attacks

Unarmed Strikes - Do not have off-hand attacks.

Secondary Attacks - Only add half of strength bonus to damage.

Ranged Attacks - The Range of a weapon is measured in Increments; 1st Increment, no penalties on Attacks, but every Increment after suffers penalties. 

**(Shorten this later.)**
If you shoot or throw a ranged weapon at a target engaged in melee with a friendly character, you take a –4 penalty on your attack roll. Two characters are engaged in melee if they are enemies of each other and either threatens the other. (An unconscious or otherwise immobilized character is not considered engaged unless he is actually being attacked.)
If your target (or the part of your target you’re aiming at, if it’s a big target) is at least 10 feet away from the nearest friendly character, you can avoid the –4 penalty, even if the creature you’re aiming at is engaged in melee with a friendly character.
If your target is two size categories larger than the friendly characters it is engaged with, this penalty is reduced to –2. There is no penalty for firing at a creature that is three size categories larger than the friendly characters it is engaged with.
**(Shorten this later.)**

Natural Attacks - You can make Natural Attacks as long as you attack with a different limb; using the claws on your hands means you can't use swords/other weapons with them.

AoO (Attacks of Oppurtunity) - You threaten everything within your Melee Range, Hor., Vert., and Diag., but if you have a Reach Weapon, you threaten the 10ft space but not the 5ft space around you unless you hold a non-reach Weapon. Moving into a threatened square of reach does not provoke AoO, but moving out of one does. You can also provoke an AoO by:
- Ranged Attacks in Melee
- Unarmed Attacks (unless you have Improved US) in Melee
- Aid Another (Situational)
- Casting Spell of Standard Action casting time
- Drink potion or apply oil
- Light torch with tindertwig
- Read scroll
- Stabilize drying friend
- Skills that take 1 Action (Usually)
- Spell-like abilities
- Control a frightened Mount
- Load a hand/light/heavy/repeating crossbow
- Move a heavy object
- Pick up an item
- Sheathe a weapon
- Stand up from prone
- Retrive stored item
- Deliver coup de grace
- Escape from net
- Light a torch
- Lock or unlock weapon in locked gauntlet
- Prepare to throw splash weapon
- Run
- Use a touch spell on up to 6 friends/allies
- Perform a Combat Maneuver (If you lack the feat)
- Use Feat (Varies)

AoO attacks are made at the full Attack Bonus, with feats that apply Attack or Damage bonuses and negatives on the attack can still apply.

When attacking with multiple AoOs. only different Actions done during a creature's turn can trigger multiple AoOs; only 1 AoO can be made while an opponent moves out of a threatened space per-round.

## Mounted Combat
Mounts require the Combat Training Trick taught through the Handle Animal Skill in order to stay in combat or they can't be controlled during Combat. 
Your Mount acts on your Initiative, and you move at your Mount's speed, but using its Move Action to move instead of your own. With a DC 5 Ride check, you can guide a Mount with your knees to free up both of your hands for Combat.
If you attack a creature smaller than your mount while standing, you get a +1 bonus on Attacks against it for being on higher ground. If your Mount moves more than 5ft, you can only make a single Melee Attack once during your turn.
If your Mount Charges, you're also charging. You deal double damage while charging with a Lance.
When using Ranged Attacks on a Mount, if it uses a double move, you get a -4 on Attack Rolls; if you attack while your Mount is Running, it's -8 for Attack Rolls. You can make Full Attacks with ranged weapons while the Mount is moving.
If  your Mount has moved before and after you cast a spell, you have to make a concentration check to cast due to the vigorous movement (DC 10 + Spell Lvl) or lose the spell. If the Mount is Running, the DC is increased by +5.
If your Mount falls, you must make a DC 15 Ride check to make a soft fall or take 1d6 points of damage.
If you're knocked unconscious while Mounted, you have a 50% change to stay in the saddle (75% on a Military Saddle); otherwise you fall and take 1d6 points of damage.
If you're not there to guide your Mount, it avoids combat unless of higher intelligence (2<).

## Throwing Splash Weapons
A splash weapon is a ranged weapon that breaks on impact, splashing or scattering its contents over its target and nearby creatures or objects using a Ranged Touch Attack.
They require no weapon proficiency, a direct hit damages the target with the splash hitting all within 5ft, and if a creature is Larger or larger, you choose one of its squares and the splash weapon hits all enemies within 5ft of the square. Splash weapons cannot deal Precision Damage. Instead of attacking a specific creature, you can choose to attack a specific grid intersection instead (AC 5). If aiming for a grid intersection, the splash damage hits all adjacent targets while dealing no Direct Hit Damage.
If you miss the target, you roll a d8 to see where the splash weapon lands; 1 means the weapon falls short, with 2-8 rotating around the target/grid intersection in a clockwise direction; then count the number of squares in the indicated direction equal to the Range Increment of the throw (E.g. 2 Ranged Increments away = lands 2 spaces away from target instead of 1). After determining where it lands, it deals splash damage to all creatures within the square and adjacent squares.

## Two-Weapon Fighting
If you're wielding an extra weapon in your off-hand, you get 1 extra attack per-round with that weapon during Full Attacks. While two-weapon fighting, you suffer a -6 with your primary hand whilst suffering a -10 with your off-hand. If your off-hand weapon is Light, the penalty is reduced by -2 for each hand; if you have the Two Weapon Fighting feat, it lessens the Primary hand penalty by -2 while reducing the off-hand penalty by -6.
When using a Double Weapon, the off-hand end of the weapon is counted as a Light Weapon, and when using thrown weapons, the same rules apply with weapons like darts and shurikens being treated as Light weapons while bolas, javelins, nets, or a sling are treated as one-handed weapons.

## Spellcasting
Casting - Usually requires a Standard Action to cast; can be done before or after a Move Action; requires Concentration to cast, and if something interrupts the Concentration, a Concentration Check is required to maintain Concentration. 
Some spells require Concentration to maintain a spell; some of them require you to maintain the spell with a Standard Action. Casting in a Threatened Space provokes an AoO, but if Defensive Casting is used, it does not threaten an AoO but requires a Concentration Check to be pulled off.
If you're hit while casting or maintaining a spell, you must perform a Concentration Check.
Spells with a Swift Action don't provoke AoO.
Touch spells must be casted before touching a Target; during that same round, touching/attempt to touch is a Free Action; you can take a Move Action or NaA to move before, during, or after casting this spell. While the act of Touching does not provoke AoO, casting still does; recommended to cast outside of Threat before moving in. All Touch spells have charge that can be held indefinitely until you touch something, but any touch can cause the spell to discharge, or casting another spell can discharge the charge.
If a beneficial Touch spell is used on an ally, you can use a Full-Round Action to apply the Touch spell up to 6 allies in total if the spell allows.
Hostile Touch spells can also be delivered with an Unarmed Strike or Natural Weapon Attack; this does not enable if performed in the same turn as Casting the spell.
If the Attack misses, the charge is maintained and not lost.

Ranged Touch Spells - Act like Ranged Attacks and can't be held as a charge for later usage.

Casting with Shields - Depending on the size of a shield, you will or will not be able to cast spells with somatic components; Bucklers can allow casting but deny you their AC until the start of your next turn, Light Shields act like Bucklers, and Heavy Shields fully deny your ability to cast spells with your off-hand.

If you carry a shield/weapon on your off-hand and no weapon in the other, you can cast with your main hand instead- or if there's weapon in the main hand, you can drop it as a Free Action to then cast the spell with your free hand.

Spell-Like Abilities - Act like spells requiring Concentration and provokes AoO, meaning it can be disrupted. If disrupted, the spell fails and 1 usage of the spell will be consumed. Tends to be 1 Standard Action unless said otherwise. Can be casted defensively (DC15 + double spell level).

Supernatural Abilities - Usually a Standard Action (unless said otherwise), can't be disrupted, does not require concentration, and does not provoke AoO.

Direct/Redirect Spells - Some spells can be directed or redirected to new targets/areas after casting, requiring a Move Action from the user whilst not provoking AoO or requiring Concentration.

Formula for creating a Spell Scroll - 25 * Spell Level * Caster Level (E.g. Magus Lvl 6 creating Lv2 Spell, that becomes 25 * 2 * 6 to reach the Gold Cost); you can change Spell Level and Caster Level during duration of the Spell Scribing to influence saves and damage-output

### Caster Level
The purposes of getting spell effects that increase the player's Caster Level is that they allow you to:
- Enhance damage earlier based on Caster Level
- Increase range based on Caster Level
- Increase duration based on Caster Level
- Increase number of targets based on Caster Level
This overall helps out the Caster reach those higher numbers with their spells, especially ones that don't have a capped limit, while still being of a lower level. However, this does not affect:
- A spell's Spell DC
