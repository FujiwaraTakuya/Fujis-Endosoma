# Jujutsu Sorcerer
_In a world where dark spirits born from human emotions, ideals, and deeply seeded regrets, select few within the world are born and matured with the ability to see, touch, and fight such evils that warp our reality. Those who fight such an unknown are called Jujutsu Sorcerers; being able to sense, control, and manipulate the energy created from their emotions to perform Cursed Techniques- special abilities unique to each individual or generation of individual that can harm, heal, protect, seal away, control, and more. Certain individuals are capable of creating unique Cursed Items to be used for combat or support, giving those without the ability to see or harm invisible spirits a way to see their aggressor(s) and fight back, but these abilities aren't just specially suited for only spirits._

## Cursed Energy Definition
Cursed Energy is a form of spiritual energy derived from the emotions of all living beings- specifically negative emotions; most don't have access or control over these wells of energy, but still have them within themselves, whilst others born with the unnatural ability to manipulate and unleash this power are able to conjure and control different aspects of it to enhance themselves and/or use unique forms of abilities known as Cursed Techniques. These Cursed Techniques or objects/limbs imbued with Cursed Energy can affect objects and creatures in the mortal plane, as well as Spirits directly to deal harm to them. This energy can be so potent and powerful that it can even affect time and space. When a person is struck and killed by someone or something imbued with Cursed Energy, the one affected by the Attack/Technique will never return from the dead as a Curse, or spawn/attract a Curse.
## Cursed Spirits Definition
The reason why Cursed Techniques were developed, was because beings labelled Curses or Cursed Spirits were born from the Cursed Energy dwelling within every creature; suffering, anger, hatred, revenge, regrets- all of these emotions can contribute to creating a Cursed Spirit, but fear is one of the most potent emotions for creating terrifying Cursed Spirits; most cases, only a single Spirit is born from this amassed Cursed Energy from the death of a being, but a Cursed Spirit can be born from the collective fear of something such as a fear of fire or blood, with their powers relating to such. They gain strength feeding off the negative emotions that exist within and emitted from all living beings, usually by consuming their victims or feeding off of the ambient energy emitted from them. When a Cursed Spirit dies, they turn into black powered wisps of Cursed Energy that dissipated into eventual nothingness.

Known ways that a Cursed Spirit can be born are:
- The cumulative Cursed Energy from those with no control over Cursed Energy like sediment
- The death of someone filled with regrets or negative emotion so intense, it spikes their Cursed Energy to the point of creating a Cursed Spirit or even an apparition
- The intense emotions one holds for someone else's death (both negative and positive) and, in turn, those emotions being strong enough to curse someone's soul and chain their being to life either as a Cursed Spirit or apparition
- A particularly powerful Jujutsu Sorcerer either with an abundant amount of Cursed Energy or great amounts of emotional turmoil that their eventual death allows them to transcend the mortal coil and become a Cursed Spirit/apparition whilst maintaining their identity, memories, and abilities
- A Special-Grade Cursed Womb being placed into a fitting vessel (usually a human) to possess and physically reconfigure them into a half-spirit half-human Cursed Spirit that exists visibly to other non-users of Cursed Energy; this usually kills the host and replaces their identity with that of the Cursed Womb.

## Curse Definition
A Curse is the term used to describe the usage of Cursed Energy to inflict harm or condition on another being; being that Cursed Energy is the manifested embodiment of powerful negative emotions within one's self, those with enough power and are unaware of their powers can unintentionally bring harm to others by actually cursing them with an ill fate. This is typically used in conjuncture with topics like to threaten others with a supernatural fate, such as cursing someone they'll haunt them after death for being the cause of their death, then coming back from the dead as a Cursed Spirit or Aberration due to the intense pain and hatred towards the other.
## Windows Definition
There are beings with unique traits, strengths, and abilities in this world thanks to their ability to manipulate Cursed Energy, but there are human individuals who're able to see these Cursed Spirits yet are unable to control their Cursed Energy due to being too weak, having next-to-no Cursed Energy or none at all but are aware of any Cursed Spirits' existence, or they are highly unsuitable to combat and thus aid Jujutsu Sorcerers on the side-lines by creating support items, handling politics and equipment, earning money, finding information, summoning veils for hopefully weak Curses, and more. This is usually something a number of young children and animals experience, which lead to them becoming outcasted or shunned for their powers or strangeness if they don't hide this truth.
## Graded Curses Explanation
Different levels of Cursed Energy bear fruit to the many different Cursed Spirits, typically graded from 4-1 then Special, from weakest to strongest; these grades can also be applied to Jujutsu Sorcerers, cursed objects, and cursed tools in their ability to defeat or their power to scale up akin to Graded Cursed Spirits referenced as such:
* Grade 4 - Usually a wide measurement of power due to the variance of threat and ability, they tend to mostly be harmless or only inflict harm upon weakened beings or lengthy prolonged subjection to their negative influence. Can easily be killed with your bare hands with a human-amount of strength.
* Grade 3 - Stronger than a Grade 4 physically, and their abilities being much more notable than their Grade 4 counterpart, Melee weapons having a tougher time hitting its target let alone injuring it, but can still die quite easily to basic firearms.
* Semi-Grade 2 - Strength or power veering between Grade 3 and 2, but there being some form of obvious weakness or general underwhelming quality which rates it lower than Grade 2 and some strength/asset which makes it above Grade 3.
* Grade 2 - These Cursed Spirits are vastly superior to their Grade 3 brethren; faster, stronger, smarter, tougher, and their powers can pose a serious threat to several Sorcerers at once without care; without Cursed Energy, stronger weaponry such as automatic or semi-automatic 2-handed firearms will be required, and even then that won't guarantee a win if not careful.
* Semi-Grade 1 - Almost enough power for one to be considered a terrifying powerhouse of a Curse if it weren't for the fact that it was probably still subduable by Grade 1 and higher Sorcerers, items, or objects.
* Grade 1 - A very powerful Curse; usually so tough, without an experienced Sorcerer nearby or on-hand, even tanks might not finish the job, with its strength matching or surpassing such.
* Special Grade 1 - Usually a case of power surpassing Grade 1 through effort, experience, continual growth, and insane abilities bordering on to near-impossible to achieve through hard work and/or powerful tutoring.
* Special Grade - No available measurements currently comparable. Usually a threat to all of society or living-kind; the power-gap usually devoids hope in all those of Grade 2 or lower.
To Simplify the above-mentioned list, here's an explanation as referenced by the Jujutsu Sorcerer Society:
* Grade 4 - "A wooden bat is enough."
* Grade 3 - "If you have a handgun, you can rest easy."
* Grade 2 - "Close call with a shotgun."
* Grade 1 - "Even a tank might be insufficient."
* Special Grade - "Cluster bombs _might_ work."
There are Cursed Spirits too weak to even be considered Grade 4, and it's possible to tame Cursed Spirits by nearly killing them and forcing them into a state of submission, forcing them into a Pact. It's possible to do the same with higher-graded Curses, but the risks and damage become significantly greater as a result, and the difficulty isn't usually worth it as Cursed Spirits don't require mortal food, rest, and do not tire easily as mortal creatures do.
## Dolls Definition
*Panda...is not a panda!!*
A doll, by simple explanation, is a puppet made from certain materials that's then imbued with Cursed Energy to then be made to fight under behalf of the Sorcerer's will. Their strength, abilities, effects, and usage vary greatly based on the design of the Cursed Energy imbued into them, but usually once turned into a Cursed Doll, they're able to be activated and deactivated like a toy by the user, whilst becoming either autonomous during its activation or manually manipulated by the Sorcerer. Most Sorcerers can prepare their Dolls on the cheap by using pre-made plushies or action figures, but others can create their own Dolls which can bot improve the Doll's Durability and affect its combat effectiveness- this includes robots with somewhat understandable or nonsensical internal machinery, or no machinery at all whatsoever in certain cases. 
## Domains Explained
Domains are the manifestation of concentrated Cursed Energy manipulated by a powerful 1st Grade or Special Grade Sorcerer/Cursed Spirit that is both deadly and terrifying to see. Not only can Domains seal those within a radius of its effect inside a near-inescapable dome that's immensely difficult to break out of, those inside are subjected to additional effects from the Technique of the Domain that make Cursed Techniques guaranteed- although the guarantee is up for debate as usually those fighting in a Domain fight to the death, and there are not many recorded instances of those who've fought others inside of a Domain with all parties alive and intact. Not only that, but Domains provide the user with a powerful boost to their physical abilities and Cursed Techniques, usually increasing their strength and ability to inflict a fatal blow.

The main downsides about these Domains are that they are:
- They consume a TON of Cursed Energy- to the point where its user can only perform it once per-day at minimum- however, stronger Curses and Sorcerers can theoretically perform their Domain more than once with enough Cursed Energy and power.
- They're destroyable if one's Cursed Technique or Attack is powerful enough to overpower the Domain's barrier.
- If a stronger, more powerful Domain is unleashed within the first Domain, it'll cancel it out and replacing it.
- While the inside is near indestructible, the outside is easy to penetrate through and create a temporary opening for others to enter or give others an exit if they're fast enough.
- Simple Domains or just barely-matching-in-strength Domains care capable of being layered within a Domain to protect the other user and those within it from the guaranteed effects of the initial Domain that was placed, or even being capable enough of bypassing the inescapable barrier and creating a hard-to-maintain hole which all inside can escape from. 
## Pacts (Binding Vows) Definition
_In exchange for greater power one does not have, something of equal or near-equal value must be offered to achieve such immense strength._
Pacts or Binding Vows are one of the essential tenets of Jujutsu Sorcery created through Cursed Energy that a Jujutsu Sorcerer can either place on themselves or with another person; the act of abiding by the rules and restrictions agreed upon in those contracts can result in a greater power or achievement of a goal, but breaking a Binding Vow has uncanny repercussions which usually harm the violator. Here are list of known Pacts that are known, but do not limit to what is possible with Pacts (due to copyright aside from one occasion cause his name needs to be mentioned, all other names will be referred to as Parties and not all Parties in each scenario are the same person):
- Vows with one's self
    - **Revealing One's Hand**: By intentionally vocally divulging their Cursed Technique to an opponent and having made them aware to your Technique, the Sorcerer can increase their Cursed Energy Output with Attacks, Skills, and/or Techniques. This is also a great way at deceiving your opponent at the intention of your Technique's abilities, or whether or not if they're capable of discerning the Technique's full capabilities.
    - **Overtime**: A Binding Vow that was used by Kento Nanami, he limits the amount of Cursed Energy he has access to (80-90%) while working a 9AM-5PM work schedule. Once his normal Shift ends and chooses/is forced to work overtime, his power increases drastically to 110-120% of his maximum power.
- Vows with others
    - **Conditional Pacts**: In exchange for a set of actions or services, something else is offered to the other party to satisfy both sides, whether they want to partake in the pact or not.
        - **Unwilling Conditional Pacts**: **Party A** forces **Party B** into a Contract that mostly or purely benefits **Party A.** **Party B** can refuse the Contract, but can also be given a 2nd contract or ultimatum that forces them to partake in an event where they can 'fight' or earn their freedom from **Party A.** They can choose to participate in the Contracts presented to them, but refusal generally results in death between one of the two Parties depending upon the situation and Pact being presented between them. This situation can involve more than 2 people.
        - **Willing Conditional Pacts**: **Party B** chooses to limit their Cursed Energy usage greatly and not use their Jujutsu Technique under any circumstances unless **Party A** request of it, and **Party A** humbly accepts the Contract; this contract stems from their own desire to please **Party A** and as a result, the power of **Party B** skyrockets greatly as a result. In another example, **Party A** offers their body and literal soul to **Party B** who's a Cursed Spirit in exchange for removing their Cursed Energy Limit and cause their power to skyrocket even higher than before.
            - **Abusing Conditional Pacts**: Whether intentional or not, there are cases where Contracts made between individuals or forced upon others can be broken without harm coming to either party, such as **Party A** wanting **Party B** to kill **Party C**, and to ensure that the deed is done, **Party B** is forced into a Contract by **Party A**; **Party B** then eventually kills **Party C** by stabbing them in the heart, completing the Contract which then causes the Cursed Energy used to fade away as a result- but then **Party B** revives **Party C** by healing the fatal wound they caused right after, leaving **Party C** intact and surprisingly alive whilst **Party B** is unpunished as **Party C** was indeed killed upon impact against their heart. Another example is **Party A** having created a Cursed Spirit from **Party B's** soul on accident due to their power from their lineage and **Party B** dying in a gruesome yet painfully human way, forcing **Party B** to remain as a literal Cursed Spirit until after the moment where **Party A**, attempting to fight a powerful foe, creates a Pact to offer their entirety to **Party B** in exchange for defeating their foe; after the battle, when **Party B** realises what's being offered, they reject the Pact that was made, and thus cancels **Party A's** original contract (which was to not die); neither side is penalized by this issue, **Party B** returns back to a regular human-like form but still a dead spirit looking like themselves the day they died, then **Party B** consoles **Party A** to live well and not die too soon.
### Heavenly Pacts Definition
_Some consider this a miracle from the gods. Others would rather curse them for the hell they'd been granted upon them._
Unlike regular Pacts, these are enforced upon a human the day they were born and have varying effects which ultimately shape the foundations of their power; while powerful, these pacts have great drawbacks that some would consider insanely detrimental to living a regular life. Here's a list of known Heavenly Pacts to serve as an example:
- Superhuman abilities, no/next-to-no Cursed Energy: Usually a super simple standard of a Heavenly Pact, most users of this Heavenly Pact are strictly inhibited in their ability to see, emit, or even control Cursed Energy; not all have their Cursed Energy Control and/or Sense neutered, but this usually leaves those with knowledge of the world of Cursed Spirits and the like more vulnerable to such beings, were it not for for those capable of creating Cursed Tools to combat specific Spirits, Abilities, and Techniques. This also makes guarding against Cursed Techniques and Attacks even more painful if not carefully judged and accounted for.
- Long-range, near-unlimited Cursed Energy Output and Control, extremely frail: There are some born with missing limbs, frail bodies, skin so vulnerable that moonlight is enough to burn their skin, and a constant need to be guarded and placed safely in life-support in order to sustain them from their constant pains even in almost pure darkness. In exchange for this hell, there are those who're given the ability to manipulate Cursed Energy over wide and long ranges, even going so far as to accurately control and see from the standpoint of the Doll they control like they were watching from their own eyes. Even whilst having this insane level of control over the Doll and their Cursed Energy, their Output tends to skyrocket far higher than any normal Sorcerer by having an insanely large pool so big, it can be considered near-infinite if it weren't for the fact that the Sorcerer would have to constantly be in pain to maintain a constant output, and when one has that pain reduced or completely healed, the Output becomes greatly weakened whilst still allowing the user to maintain the massive amount of stored Cursed Energy within themselves.

## Class Abilities
### Birth Route
_Those who were born strong should protect the weak from the strong, no matter how painful their lives as a Jujutsu Sorcerer lead them down._
Jujutsu Sorcerers are either born able to manipulate their Cursed Energy naturally or after being taught, or are born with a Heavenly Pact which grants greater powers in exchange for damning inflictions to one's self. One can also be born to one of the great 3 Clans of the Jujutsu Sorcerer World or one of the lesser families in said-clans and be born with Hereditary Techniques that are passed on through strong bloodlines and selective breeding- but because of this, while members of these families generally have powerful Cursed Techniques, many born with these Techniques are unlikely or capable of discovering new Cursed Techniques. These can be considered Archetypes for the sake of simplification. 

### Cursed Energy Manipulation
_Usually at a young age, or whenever their ability to see Cursed Spirits or manipulate Cursed Energy manifests, a possible Jujutsu Sorcerer is made apparent of the world they're entering and usually trained to become a Sorcerer into their later-life on top of teaching them the basics of society. When using Cursed Energy, emitted by one's self as a blue flame-like aura with a black edge and black sparks, like a lake leading down to a river, both the amount maintained and the output of strength gradually grow bigger with the continual usage and training, and either reaching its eventual end, or presenting a new beginning through a new power._
Jujutsu Sorcerers are Spontaneous Casters who use Cursed Energy which is unlike Magic.

At Level 1, the Max Cursed Energy a user can hold within themselves, called their Cursed Energy Pool, equals 2d10 - 1 + Con Mod; not all Jujutsu Sorcerers are born equal. Every Level after the first, increase the Max Cursed Energy by d6 + Con Mod. With a Swift Action, the Jujutsu Sorcerer can perform one of many Cursed Abilities:
* For 2 points, a Sorcerer imbues their body and weapon to strike better and more accurately, giving themselves a +1 Enhancement Bonus to their next Attack and Damage Rolls; this Bonus increases by +1 every 4 Levels of Jujutsu Sorcerer taken.
* For each point spent, a Sorcerer protects their body by flooding the attacked area with Cursed Energy like a barrier, creating a Temp. HP aura equal to 1 point per point of Cursed Energy used up to half of their total HP; this aura only lasts as long as the aura has Temp. HP left or the user maintains it during their next Turn with a Swift Action, otherwise the shield dissipates. The amount of Temp. HP gained increases by +1 point at Level 3 and every 3 Levels after of this class taken. This Ability can be used as a Reaction to incoming damage, but the amount of Temp. HP gained is reduced by half.
* As a Reaction towards a Critical Hit, a Jujutsu Sorcerer can choose to spend 5% of their Max Cursed Energy to increase the AC to Crit. Confirm against them by +2; if the Critical Hit is confirmed, the user can then use 25% of their Max Cursed Energy Pool to reduce the damage of an incoming Critical Hit by 15%.
* Spend 1 point of Cursed Energy to temporarily increase a single Skill's Rank per-point of Energy used on a Skill reliant upon Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma, lasting 1 minute and capped out to a quarter of the Level of the Jujutsu Sorcerer Class.
* Spend 4 points to enhance the Sorcerer's next Damage roll with their Cursed Technique by 1d4; at Level 4 this increases to 1d6; at Level 8 this increases to 1d8; at Level 12 this increases 1d10; at Level 16 this increases to 2d6; at Level 20, this increases to 2d8.

At Level 6 a Jujutsu Sorcerer is capable of performing up to 2 Cursed Abilities simultaneously as a Swift Action, or 1 Cursed Ability as a Free Action per-round.

At Level 11, Jujutsu Sorcerers are able to start using Advanced Cursed Abilities; at this level, they are capable of performing an Advanced Cursed Ability as a Swift Action and 1-2 Cursed Abilities as a Free Action, but can only perform 2 Cursed Abilities at any one time. The list of Advanced Cursed Abilities are listed as such:
- For 6 points, a Sorcerer imbues their body and weapon to strike better and more accurately, giving themselves a +1 Enhancement Bonus to Attack and +2 Enhancement Bonus to Damage Rolls for 2 Rounds; this Bonus increases by +1 every 3 Levels of Jujutsu Sorcerer taken.
* For every 2 points spent, a sorcerer creates a barrier with Cursed Energy used to protect their body from Cursed Techniques/Domain Attacks, creating a Temp. HP aura equal to 1 per 2 points of Cursed Energy used up to half of their total HP; this aura only lasts as long as the aura has Temp. HP left or the user maintains it during their next Turn with a Swift Action, otherwise the shield dissipates. The barrier also provides a +1 Bonus to Will and Fortitude Saves. The amount of Temp. HP gained and the Bonus to Saves increases by +1 point at Level 4 and every 4 Levels after of this class taken. This Ability can be used as a Reaction to incoming damage, but the amount of Temp. HP gained is reduced by half.
* For every 3 points spent, the Sorcerer enhances their Acrobatics, Climb, Escape Artist, Perception, Ride, Sleight of Hand, Stealth, and Swim Skill Checks equal to 1 Skill Rank per 3 points spent for this Ability up to a maximum of double the Jujutsu Sorcerer's Level specific to this class.
* Spend 7 points to enhance the Sorcerer's next Damage roll with their Cursed Technique by 2d6; at Level 13 this increases to 2d8; at Level 15 this increases to 3d6; at Level 17 this increases 3d8; at Level 19 this increases to 4d6; at Level 20, this increases to 4d8.

At Level 19, a Jujutsu Sorcerers are able to start using Special Cursed Abilities; at this level, they are capable of performing a Superior Cursed Ability as a Standard Action, an Advanced Cursed Ability as a Swift Action, and 1-2 Cursed Abilities as a Free Action, but can only perform 2 Cursed Abilities at any one time. The list of Superior Cursed Abilities are listed as such:
- For 18 points, a Sorcerer imbues their body and weapon to strike better and more accurately, giving themselves a +2 Enhancement Bonus to Attack and +3 Enhancement Bonus to Damage Rolls for 3 Rounds; this Bonus increases by +1 every 2.5 Levels of Jujutsu Sorcerer Class rounded down.
- Using 5 points, the user creates a barrier surrounding the immediate area around themselves in a 5ft square called a Simple Domain; this barrier helps in protecting the Sorcerer from Domain Attacks and specific Cursed Techniques that create an offensive aura against the Sorcerer, negating bonuses to Attack Rolls and Damage enhancements from the Domain's owner whilst also creating a 5ft radius Sensor that enhances a Sorcerer's Reflex Save to anything that enters the field; if the Reflex Save is successful, the Sorcerer can make an Attack of Opportunity against the creature that enters at +4, and any weapon or projectile that enters the space can be cut out from the air like the Weapon Mastery Feat, Cut from the Air. You can only make as many Attacks of Opportunity as you have available Attacks of Opportunity. This Ability is maintained as a Free action with a subsequent payment of 5 additional points, and requires Concentration to keep active, but this Concentration is broken if the user Moves or is forcefully moved from the initially-activated spot they're attacking from.
* Spend 13 points to enhance the Sorcerer's next Damage roll with their Cursed Technique by 4d6; for each extra point spent increases the total damage by +1.

Cursed Abilities are unlike Cursed Techniques in that they can be taught to and learnt by other people, being universal abilities any Jujutsu Sorcerer is capable of learning and wielding.

At Level 2 and every 2 Levels after with this Class, Jujutsu Sorcerers gain access to Cursed Ability Feats which can augment or teach them new Cursed Abilities; at Level 11, the Sorcerer gains access to Advanced Cursed Ability Feats and an extra Cursed Ability Feat of their choice; at Level 19, the Sorcerer gains access to Special Cursed Ability Feats, and an extra Cursed Ability Feat of their choice.

#### Cursed Techniques
_Unlike Cursed Abilities, Cursed Techniques are etched into the body the day they are born, meaning it's impossible to learn Cursed Techniques from others._
Cursed Techniques are unique to each individual unless you were born to one of the 3 main clans of the Jujutsu Sorcery world which learn of Hereditary Techniques passed on by generation. This step you'll need to discuss your idea with your DM.

Based upon the complexity of the idea, the cost, damage, range of effect, and what the ability does to a Target varies greatly.
### Cursed Energy Sense
_The Sorcerer is capable of seeing spirits normally invisible to the naked eye due to the aura of energy they emit from their presence. They are also able to sense the nearby intense emotions emitted by other beings, even whilst being physically hidden, but cannot detect calmer emotions._
Jujutsu Sorcerers are able to see any Spirit within line-of-sight including non-Cursed Spirits that are invisible with supernatural abilities and ignore Concealment unless they use a Spell that achieves invisibility.

At Level 1, they can also sense the Cursed Energy around them within a 15ft radius centred upon themselves, and have a+3 Perception Circumstance Bonus while detecting Spirit; +2 when a spirit within range is attempting to conceal its presence; +1 for sensing the intense emotions of Living and Undead beings; this ability can sense through walls.

The radius of this Sense increases by +15ft at Level 2 and for every 2 Levels taken after, and for every 2 Levels of this Class, the above-mentioned Circumstance Bonus is increased by each amount up to a maximum of 30/20/10.
### Cursed Energy Detection
_With proper tutelage and training, a Jujutsu Sorcerer can track any Cursed Spirit that hides its tracks by sensing the trail of Cursed Energy they'll inevitably leave being a being made of Cursed Energy, even eventually being able to sense their very strength and be warned of their capabilities- although not clearly discerned; almost every Cursed Spirit is incapable of completely hiding away their Cursed energy from the keen eye of a Jujutsu Sorcerer- like a hunter tracking its prey._
When attempting to find evidence of the leftover usage or existence of Cursed Energy within an area or environment, the Sorcerer's special sight gives them the ability to see trails and leftover specs of Cursed Energy left by Spirits or People, allowing them to track the movements they'd made long-after they'd left the area or trace their current position within a visible area using a Survival Check with a +2 Circumstance Bonus, but the traces left aren't explicitly telling if it was made intentionally or not; this ability can be activated and deactivated as a Free Action.

This ability can also be used to make a Sense Motive Check on Cursed Energy used by other users within the reach of a Jujutsu Sorcerer's Cursed Energy Sense to detect the immediate intention of their attack, ability, or actions specifically involving Cursed Energy; giving a +3 Circumstance Bonus to Sense Motive Checks. At Level 2 and every 2nd Level after, this Bonus is increased by +2.
### Intense Emotion Fluctuation
*Do not let your emotions consume you. It can interrupt the flow of Cursed Energy and either weaken or strengthen your control over your powers.*
When an ally has fainted, died, been partially dismembered, dying, Petrified, or been injured greatly (had HP reduced by 10% of Max HP in 1 Round), or the Sorcerer themselves has been Antagonized, made Cowering, Exhausted, Fascinated, Frightened, made Helpless, Nauseated, Panicked, Paralyzed, Shaken, Sickened, Staggered, or Stunned, the Sorcerer must make a Will Save to realise the condition their ally or themselves have been left in and a Fortitude Save to regain their composure and not lose their chill.

Succeeding the Will Save will suppress the Sorcerer's Antagonized, Cowering, Fascinated, Frightened, Panicked, Shaken, Sickened, and Staggered conditions whilst granting them a +5 bonus to Perception, Sense motive, Diplomacy, and Bluff Skill Checks, and a +1 to their AC; failing the Will Save will leave the sorcerer still under the condition's effects, reduce their Perception, Intimidate, Sense motive, Diplomacy, and Bluff Skill Checks by -5, and reduce their AC by -4. At Level 8 the skill bonus is increased to +10/-10 whilst the AC bonus is increased to +2/-3; at Level 16 the skill bonus is increased to +15/-15 whilst the AC bonus is increased to +4/-2.
Succeeding the Fortitude Save will help the Sorcerer maintain a calm composure while taming the fury within themselves, granting a +1 Enhancement bonus to their Attack rolls and an additional 1d6 to their Damage Rolls; failing the Fortitude Save, the Sorcerer has their Attack rolls reduced by -6 whilst increasing their damage by 3d6. At Level 8 the Attack bonus increases to +3/-4 while the Damage bonus increases to 1d10/4d6; at Level 16 the Attack bonus increases to +5/-3 while the Damage bonus increases to 2d8/5d6.

The duration of this Class Ability is double the Jujutsu Sorcerer's Class Level.
### Black Flash (黒こく閃せん _Kokusen_)
_A distortion of space born from the impact of Cursed Energy delivered within 0.0000000000001 (Trillionth) of a second of a blow. It delivers 2.5 times the damage of a normal strike. There are no Sorcerers who can use the Black Flash consistently.... However... between those who have experienced Black Flash and those who have not, their distance from the core of Cursed Energy is like that of Heaven from Earth. The instant Cursed Energy impacts within 0.0000000000001 (Trillionth) of a second of a blow, space is distorted cursed energy flashes black (with a red outline). The record for the most Black Flashes performed consecutively is 4 in a row._
If a Jujutsu Sorcerer lands a Critical Hit Melee or Ranged non-magic/supernatural ability Attack imbued with Cursed Energy upon an enemy and Crit-Confirms with an unmodified 20, the user enters The Zone, the attack deals an additional 25% damage (rounded down), ignore Physical Resistances, Sunders either a targeted or randomly rolled piece of equipment the enemy has on them (Separate non-crit Damage roll with 50% more damage dealt), and creates a visual of a black flash of light only visible to those with Cursed Energy Sense.

Enemies struck with the Black Flash must roll a Fortitude Save with a DC 15 + the Sorcerer's Damage Modifier or suffer the Staggered Condition for 1 Round- Critical Failure on the Save changes the Condition to Stunned instead; if the Black Flash is Crit-Confirmed with another unmodified 20, failure to Save Stuns instead whilst increasing the DC to succeed the Save by +3.
#### The Zone
After a Jujutsu Sorcerer lands a Black Flash, the user enters a state named The Zone, where their senses are heightened and can increase the chances to perform the Black Flash again whilst in this state.
The Zone lasts for 1 minute, its timer resetting upon landing another Crit confirmed with another unmodified 20, 
While in The Zone, Sorcerers get a +1 bonus to Critical Hits and a +2 bonus to Crit Confirms; these Bonuses increase by an additional +1/+2 for each successive Crit made up to a maximum Bonus of +5/+6, but failing to land a crit or not rolling a crit reduces this Bonus by -1/-2 to a minimum of +1/+1.
They also gain a Bonus to Reflex and Fortitude Saves equal to 1 + 1 per 4 Levels in Jujutsu Sorcerer while in The Zone.
### Veil
_Emerge from darkness, blacker than darkness. Purify that which is impure._
At Level 5, uttering the above phrase, a Jujutsu Sorcerer is capable of creating a ink-like barrier using their Cursed Energy or Cursed Object to temporarily seal an area down and let certain things and/or beings in and out using restrictions. The stronger the user, the more Cursed Energy used to form the Veil, and the more restraining the restriction of what is allowed in and out of the veil, the harder it becomes to destroy the Veil both inside and out. The only ways to dissipate the Veil are to kill the caster of the Veil, the caster to release the Veil under their own volition, or for the user to remove/break the Cursed Object which can normally only be moved or broken with Cursed Energy. It is possible to destroy a Veil with Cursed Energy, but one would need to have powers akin to a Special Grade in order to perform such a feat.
A sorcerer spends their Cursed Energy in 3 ways:
- HP - For each point of Cursed Energy used to create a Veil's HP, it translates to 25 HP the Veil will have.
- Hardness - For each point of Cursed Energy used to improve the Veil's toughness, it translates to 1 point of Hardness the Veil will have.
- Radius - For each point of Cursed Energy used to discern the Veil's range, it translates to 100ft of diameter in both width and height.

At 10th Level, the user can choose to either increase the HP gain for each point of Cursed Energy up to 50 HP per-point, increase the amount of Hardness a Veil will have per-point to 5, or increase the diameter per-point of Cursed Energy to 200ft; one of these effects can be chosen every time a new Veil is being produced. At Level 15, the conversion of Cursed Energy to HP per-point increases to 100 per-point, 10 per-point for Hardness, or 250ft per point for diameter; a user can choose 2 of the total 3 effects to apply to a new Veil every time is placed. At Level 20, the user can choose to benefit from the increase to HP, Hardness, and Diameter increase to their Veil simultaneously or optionally every time they generate a new Veil.

A Veil has a 4th property to it that is directly influenced by what effects a Veil has; this part of the cost is determined by the GM based on the conditions being set by the user. A Sorcerer can ignore this cost if a Veil is not being casted to keep all those inside invisible to those outside of the Veil, if the damage inflicted on the surroundings aren't suppressed, the sound inside isn't being suppressed, the barrier is visible to non-Sorcerers, and nothing is allowed both in and out of the Veil until dispelled.
### Domain Expansion
*The culmination of a Jujutsu Sorcerer or high-grade Curse's arsenal through their understanding of Cursed Energy, those who're inside are guaranteed to be hit by any Cursed Technique thrown their way by the owner of the Domain.*
While most Jujutsu Sorcerers are never powerful enough to unleash a Domain of their own, those who can reveal a realm of their creation made with concentrated Cursed Energy; the terrain within is a reflection of one's self and power, varying in appearance and design, and usually brings a unique power that strengthens or aids in a user's Cursed Technique application, such as turning summoned Shikigami/Cursed Spirits to become invisible or enabling them to control the environment within the Domain to attack those within the Domain. While weaker Domains can be overpowered by stronger Domains, overlapping the two with the stronger Domain revealing its form over the weaker, a strong enough Domain use can manifest their Domain within the other's to create a disparity within the barrier that holds them inside, and as a result allow any unwilling parties to choose to escape back outside of the barrier. The duration of the Domain is determined by the amount of Cursed Energy consumed when summoning the Domain with the phrase, "Domain Expansion: (Insert name of the user's domain)". 

At Level 10, spending 75% of their Current Cursed Energy Pool + the points needed to create a Veil of the user's size, Jujutsu Sorcerers are able to visualise, conceptualize, and manipulate their Cursed Energy into a unique, powerful Technique called a Domain; expanding the Cursed Energy within one's self akin to a Veil but with the user at the edge of the Domain instead of the centre, the user entraps themselves with nearby targets inside a dome of Cursed Energy that conditionally makes those stuck within one unable to escape the confines of the near-infinite space generated from said-Domain whilst making it somewhat easy to break into one. They also gain unique Techniques called Domain Attacks which either augment or give an additional power only capable of being used while within their own Domain. While in a Domain, any Cursed Technique that creates an aura around its user/target of the effect that isn't made by the owner of the Domain is suppressed, the Sorcerer's highest Stat Modifier is increased by +3, their 2nd highest is increased by +2, and the next two by +1, their Cursed Techniques/Domain Attacks increase in Damage by 25%, the user's Cursed Techniques gain a +5 bonus to Attack rolls (Although range requirements and conditions are still required), and the user of the Domain can manipulate their surroundings to a varying degree of control in tandem with the additional effects their Domain provides their Techniques.
At Level 15, the amount of Damage inflicted by their Cursed Techniques or Domain Attacks is increased by 50% while in their Domain, while giving them a +10 to Attack rolls with the Techniques/Domain Attacks; at Level 20, the Damage is increased by 100% whilst giving them a +20 to Attack rolls.

At Level 12 and every 2 levels after, a Jujutsu Sorcerer can enhance/augment their Domain with a Domain Feat to enhance their Domain's abilities or effectiveness upon its user; at Level 16, the Sorcerer gains access to Advanced Domain Feats; at Level 20, the Sorcerer gains access to 1 Special Domain Feat.
