# Jujutsu Sorcerer
_In a world where dark spirits born from human emotions, ideals, and deeply seeded regrets, select few within the world are born and matured with the ability to see, touch, and fight such evils that warp our reality. Those who fight such an unknown are called Jujutsu Sorcerers; being able to sense, control, and manipulate the energy created from their emotions to perform Cursed Techniques- special abilities unique to each individual or generation of individual that can harm, heal, protect, seal away, control, and more. Certain individuals are capable of creating unique Cursed Items to be used for combat or support, giving those without the ability to see or harm invisible spirits a way to see their aggressor(s) and fight back, but these abilities aren't just specially suited for only spirits._

# Cursed Energy Definition
Cursed Energy is a form of spiritual energy derived from the emotions of all living beings- specifically negative emotions; most don't have access or control over these wells of energy, but still have them within themselves, whilst others born with the unnatural ability to manipulate and unleash this power are able to conjure and control different aspects of it to enhance themselves and/or use unique forms of abilities known as Cursed Techniques. These Cursed Techniques or objects/limbs imbued with Cursed Energy can affect objects and creatures in the mortal plane, as well as Spirits directly to deal harm to them. This energy can be so potent and powerful that it can even affect time and space.
# Cursed Spirits Definition
The reason why Cursed Techniques were developed, was because beings labelled Curses or Cursed Spirits were born from the Cursed Energy dwelling within every creature; suffering, anger, hatred, revenge, regrets- all of these emotions can contribute to creating a Cursed Spirit, but fear is one of the most potent emotions for creating terrifying Cursed Spirits; most cases, only a single Spirit is born from this amassed Cursed Energy from the death of a being, but a Cursed Spirit can be born from the collective fear of something such as a fear of fire or blood, with their powers relating to such. They gain strength feeding off the negative emotions that exist within and emitted from all living beings, usually by consuming their victims or feeding off of the ambient energy emitted from them
# Graded Curses Explanation
Different levels of Cursed Energy bear fruit to the many different Cursed Spirits, typically graded from 4-1 then Special, from weakest to strongest; these grades can also be applied to Jujutsu Sorcerers, cursed objects, and cursed tools in their ability to defeat or their power to scale up akin to Graded Cursed Spirits referenced as such:
* Grade 4 - Usually a wide measurement of power due to the variance of threat and ability, they tend to mostly be harmless or only inflict harm upon weakened beings or lengthy prolonged subjection to their negative influence. Can easily be killed with your bare hands with a human-amount of strength.
* Grade 3 - Stronger than a Grade 4 physically, and their abilities being much more notable than their Grade 4 counterpart, Melee weapons having a tougher time hitting its target let alone injuring it, but can still die quite easily to basic firearms.
* Semi-Grade 2 - Strength or power veering between Grade 3 and 2, but there being some form of obvious weakness or general underwhelming quality which rates it lower than Grade 2 and some strength/asset which makes it above Grade 3.
* Grade 2 - These Cursed Spirits are vastly superior to their Grade 3 brethren; faster, stronger, smarter, tougher, and their powers can pose a serious threat to several Sorcerers at once without care; without Cursed Energy, stronger weaponry such as automatic or semi-automatic 2-handed firearms will be required, and even then that won't guarantee a win if not careful.
* Semi-Grade 1 - Almost enough power for one to be considered a terrifying powerhouse of a Curse if it weren't for the fact that it was probably still subduable by Grade 1 and higher Sorcerers, items, or objects.
* Grade 1 - A very powerful Curse; usually so tough, without an experienced Sorcerer nearby or on-hand, even tanks might not finish the job, with its strength matching or surpassing such.
* Special Grade 1 - Usually a case of power surpassing Grade 1 through effort, experience, continual growth, and insane abilities bordering on to near-impossible to achieve through hard work and/or powerful tutoring.
* Special Grade - No available measurements currently comparable. Usually a threat to all of society or living-kind; the power-gap usually devoids hope in all those of Grade 2 or lower.
To Simplify the above-mentioned list, here's an explanation as referenced by the Jujutsu Sorcerer Society:
* Grade 4 - "A wooden bat is enough."
* Grade 3 - "If you have a handgun, you can rest easy."
* Grade 2 - "Close call with a shotgun."
* Grade 1 - "Even a tank might be insufficient."
* Special Grade - "Cluster bombs _might_ work."

# Class Abilities
## Cursed Energy Manipulation
_Usually at a young age, or whenever their ability to see Cursed Spirits or manipulate Cursed Energy manifests, a possible Jujutsu Sorcerer is made apparent of the world they're entering and usually trained to become a Sorcerer into their later-life on top of teaching them the basics of society. When using Cursed Energy, emitted by one's self as a blue flame-like aura with a black edge and black sparks, like a lake leading down to a river, both the amount maintained and the output of strength gradually grow bigger with the continual usage and training, and either reaching its eventual end, or presenting a new beginning through a new power._
Jujutsu Sorcerers are Spontaneous Casters who use Cursed Energy which is unlike Magic.
At Level 1, the Max Cursed Energy a user can hold within themselves equals 2d10 - 1 + Con Mod. Every Level after the first, increase the Max Cursed Energy by d6 + Con Mod.
## Cursed Energy Sense
_The Sorcerer is capable of seeing spirits normally invisible to the naked eye due to the aura of energy they emit from their presence. They are also able to sense the nearby intense emotions emitted by other beings, even whilst being physically hidden, but cannot detect calmer emotions._
Jujutsu Sorcerers are able to see any Spirit within line-of-sight including non-Cursed Spirits that are invisible with supernatural abilities and ignore Concealment unless they use a Spell that achieves invisibility.
At Level 1, they can also sense the Cursed Energy around them within a 15ft radius centred upon themselves, and have a+3 Perception Circumstance Bonus while detecting Spirit; +2 when a spirit within range is attempting to conceal its presence; +1 for sensing the intense emotions of Living and Undead beings; this ability can sense through walls.
The radius of this Sense increases by +15ft at Level 2 and for every 2 Levels taken after, and for every 2 Levels of this Class, the above-mentioned Circumstance Bonus is increased by each amount up to a maximum of 30/20/10.
## Cursed Energy Detection
_With proper tutelage and training, a Jujutsu Sorcerer can track any Cursed Spirit that hides its tracks by sensing the trail of Cursed Energy they'll inevitably leave being a being made of Cursed Energy, even eventually being able to sense their very strength and be warned of their capabilities- although not clearly discerned; almost every Cursed Spirit is incapable of completely hiding away their Cursed energy from the keen eye of a Jujutsu Sorcerer- like a hunter tracking its prey._
When attempting to find evidence of the leftover usage or existence of Cursed Energy within an area or environment, the Sorcerer's special sight gives them the ability to see trails and leftover specs of Cursed Energy left by Spirits or People, allowing them to track the movements they'd made long-after they'd left the area or trace their current position within a visible area using a Survival Check with a +2 Circumstance Bonus, but the traces left aren't explicitly telling if it was made intentionally or not; this ability can be activated and deactivated as a Free Action.
This ability can also be used to make a Sense Motive Check on Cursed Energy used by other users within the reach of a Jujutsu Sorcerer's Cursed Energy Sense to detect the immediate intention of their attack, ability, or actions specifically involving Cursed Energy; giving a +3 Circumstance Bonus to Sense Motive Checks. At Level 2 and every 2nd Level after, this Bonus is increased by +2.
## Black Flash

If a Jujutsu Sorcerer lands a Critical Hit Melee or Ranged non-magic/supernatural ability Attack imbued with Cursed Energy upon an enemy and Crit-Confirms with an unmodified 20, the user enters The Zone, the attack deals an additional 25% damage (rounded down), ignore Physical Resistances, Sunders either a targeted or randomly rolled piece of equipment the enemy has on them (Separate non-crit Damage roll with 50% more damage dealt), and creates a visual of a black flash of light only visible to those with Cursed Energy Sense.
Enemies struck with 
### The Zone
After a Jujutsu Sorcerer lands a Black Flash, the user enters a state named The Zone, where their senses are heightened and can increase the chances to perform the Black Flash again whilst in this state.
The Zone lasts for 1 minute, its timer resetting upon landing another Crit confirmed with another unmodified 20, 
While in The Zone, Sorcerers get a +1 bonus to Critical Hits and a +2 bonus to Crit Confirms; these Bonuses increase by an additional +1/+2 for each successive Crit made up to a maximum Bonus of +5/+6, but failing to land a crit or not rolling a crit reduces this Bonus by -1/-2 to a minimum of +1/+1.
They also gain a Bonus to Reflex and Fortitude Saves equal to 1 + 1 per 4 Levels in Jujutsu Sorcerer while in The Zone.
