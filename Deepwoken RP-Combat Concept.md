# Statistics
These are the Health/Personal statistics to keep one's self alive, listed as such:
- HP - How many times you can get hit with Physical and Elemental Damage.
- Posture - How many times a Player can be hit while Blocking/in Super Armor before their Guard is broken and unable to attack for 3 seconds.
- Blood - How much Blood that exists inside a person before they suffer Anemia/Bloodloss.
- Tempo - Player's Passive Ether-gain and permittable Vent-gauge.
- Ether - Player's 'Magic' gauge for Mantra-usage; regens outside of combat.
- Sanity - Semi-permanent Psychological damage; max damage explodes the Player's head and instantly sends them into The Depths.

**HP** - All players/humanoid creatures start with 10 Max HP.

**Posture** - All players/humanoid creatures start with 10 Max Posture. In Combat, Posture starts at 0, and breaks when the Max is reached before leaving the Defender helpless for 2 Seconds and this helplessness moves over to the next Round.

**Blood** - All players/living creatures start with 100 Max Blood. Taking damage removes points of Blood from your Blood Gauge, causing deadly problems if it's empty. This issue can be healed with rest at a campfire, but it takes in-game time to heal the blood back- around 3 seconds for each point of Blood recovered. Blood can only be healed while resting at a Campfire, and while the player's hunger is sated.

**Tempo** - All players/humanoid creatures start with 100 Max Tempo. Outside of combat and before combat starts, Tempo always remains at 0. When a humanoid creature is hit for the first time in combat, their Tempo rises up to 45 instantly, and for every 25 points of Tempo gained, increase the creature's Ether generation per-Round by +1.

**Ether** - All players start with 100 Max Ether. Players naturally regen 5 point of Ether per 6 seconds outside of combat. At the start of Combat each Round, all Players Regen 1 point of Ether, and only at the start of each Round. The amount Regen'd is influenced by the player's Tempo. Other humanoid creatures unlike Players do not have Ether requirements, but instead have predictable attack sequences.

**Sanity** - All players/humanoid creatures start with 100 Max Sanity. Sanity will always start at 0 where one is sane, but as they're assaulted with effects that raise one's Sanity gauge, the only way to lessen and save one's sanity is by killing creatures from The Depths.

# Combat Explained
## Combat Part 1: Round 1: Battle-Start
All Players and NPCs acting as participants will start off combat simultaneously unless the following is acted upon:
- Ambush takes the player/NPC by surprise
- Aware of an Ambush and pre-planning a course of action against the Ambush
- NPCs are given the highest Initiative for their 1st/Scripted Actions before giving them a normal Initiative
- Players are given advanced Initiatives for certain criteria
- Certain Talents affect the way combat is played
All Actions in a Round are performed in 4 seconds amongst all participants, with spacing being determined as 5ft = 1 Square. In a fair fight/duel, the distance between a player and their opponent is 10ft, but in randomised combat, distance can vary greatly depending on intentions, actions, and desires. In those 4 seconds, a player's Actions Economy to use Actions in that time is split up in the duration of what they can do in those 4 Seconds. Each Action has their own Speed, Duration, and Cost to use, so it should be expected certain Actions and Mantras to be faster than others.

Movement can happen any time during Combat, including splitting 
Moves between Attacks if both creatures are moving while attacking, but hit creatures lose all ability to move to new spaces, but does not disable their ability to evade/guard attacks.

Rounds only move on to the next once all available Actions have been chosen and taken.

There are 3 types of Combat-States: Assault, Attack, and Defence. On Round 1, all participants are in Assault Mode unless specified otherwise.
### Combat State: Assault Mode
All creatures in Assault Mode act Simultaneously to one and another and perform competing Actions in order to shift themselves into Attack Mode; their 1st Action will compete against each other for speed with those landing their hit first enabling them to act in Attack Mode on the next Round whilst putting their opponent into Defence Mode and continue fighting with their advantage. Those in Assault Mode can Attack or Defend semi-freely.
The Player who lands their 1st Attack upon another Creature in Assault Mode will immediately cease any Actions they had Queued up for their Turn during that Round. This also locks that Player and those hit by their Attack(s) into Attack and Defence Modes respectively. Those who weren't hit remain in Assault Mode until they've been hit/land a hit.
### Combat State: Attack Mode
Creatures in Assault Mode have active advantage fighting other creatures, being fully capable of attacking enemies to their heart's content whilst also maintaining the ability to Dodge, Block, Parry, Vent, and use Items.
If you're hit by an Attack or some other Action during your Attack Mode, you're automatically placed into Defence Mode, and whatever Seconds you have left in your Turn, with the next Second available being impossible for the player to Block, Dodge, use Items, Attack, or Cast Mantras, are turned into your Defence Mode Actions that you can designate in the heat of the moment before the end of your Turn.
If a Defence Mode creature successfully lands a Vent against you, you're both placed back into Assault Mode.
### Combat State: Defence Mode
Creatures in Defence Mode have a disadvantage in combat, usually placed in this state after taking a hit; during the 1st actable Second after being placed into Defence Mode, the creature can't Attack, Block, Dodge, use Items, or cast Mantras due to hit-stun, but every Second that comes after, the creature can Block and Dodge upcoming attacks that threaten them.
If a Creature in Defence Mode lands a Parry against their opponent's Attack, both parties switch Modes i.e. Defence to Attack and Attack to Defence, and thus the Creature in Attack Mode can now do actions only permittable in Attack Mode.
If you're able to successfully land a Vent against a creature in Attack Mode, you and all creatures within the radius of the Vent are pushed back and placed back into Assault Mode.

## Combat Part 2: Round 2+: Battle-Onwards.
From Round 2 onwards, if any creature is in Assault Mode, they'll act first and simultaneously at any target of their choosing; if a creature/multiple creatures are in Attack Mode, each must roll a dice with the higher number of the group dictating the initiative-order of each group who Attacks  and Defends first, whilst also making the ones at the top of that Initiative Order attack simultaneously with those in Assault Mode.

Combat will continue to go on like this until one side is all Knocked, Dead, Carried, all but 1 side have managed to successfully flee Combat, or a mixture of the 4.
