This is a semi-detailed explanation on how to create your own Enemies for Tiny Dungeons-style gameplay quickly and effectively in short amounts of time. If you don't have time to think of or create an enemy, check the Beastiary for examples or a choice of creatures.

Note, this process is different for each style of quick-creation, so speed-periods will vary if you need sudden additions or are pre-preparing encounters.
# Endosoma/Tiny Dungeons Enemy Creator

## HP
Base it off of size or length of encounter; weaker enemies/fodder should die between 1-2 points of Damage, strong ones should be 3-4, and specials should be higher than that; HP for later enemies should get higher if player damage increases in higher-level areas.
## Damage Output
Generally, since enemies are more-likely to outnumber players, enemies should usually deal 1-2 damage at early levels; try to aim for a balance of numbers and equipped encounters to not overwhelm players but still give them a challenge; remember to keep luck of rolls in mind.
## Special Abilities
Try not to make them overly complicated unless they're a special NPC.
## Strengths and Weaknesses
Don't be stupid and give them valid weaknesses and strengths; unless they're special enemies with conditional weaknesses and strengths, make them reasonably vulnerable to damage types.

# Pokemon Enemy Creator

# HP
Base it off of size or length of encounter; weaker Pokemon/fodder should faint between 1-3 points of Damage, strong ones should be 4-6, and specials should be higher than that; HP for later enemies should get higher if player damage increases in higher-level areas.
## Damage Output
Generally, since enemies are more-likely to outnumber players, enemies should usually deal 1-2 damage at early levels; try to aim for a balance of numbers and equipped encounters to not overwhelm players but still give them a challenge; remember to keep luck of rolls in mind.

Available Moves should be 4 of DM's choice and no more, but special NPCs have access to a larger library of Moves like Players.
# Special Abilities
Keep it relatively simple, and don't overload due to expansive Move Pools and generally being scarier than regular TTRPG enemies. Avoid Pokemon Abilities for now until game is more solidified.
# Strengths and Weaknesses
Keep a list of a species' Strengths and Weaknesses to damage types on-hand nearby; use the latest Pokemon Game's Type Chart as an example.
