## Gardien du Ventre (Belly Guardian) (Class Trait)
*My body is my shield, and my spear### you cannot deter either!* At the start of each day, depending upon the number of people who’ve spent their night within you, you gain +1 Temporary Health-Shield Points up to a maximum equal to the number of Traits you have. These can only be replenished once per day during the morning, last until the start of sleep or until you run out of Temp. HSP, and only if the people inside you have been inside since the start of your sleep.
### Thick Skin
*You’re so fat, despite being hit by that troll’s club, I barely felt a thing!* While having someone inside them, if an attack were directed towards someone within them, their body absorbs the blow of the attack for them, taking only 1 point of the total damage while any remaining goes to your ally. (Prereq: Belly Guardian, filled belly)

### Powerful Swallowing 
*Phew- any longer in that slime and I probably would’ve lost my pants.* Your internal muscles are so strong, you make all Tests to swallow your allies stuck in rough terrain at Standard. (Prereq: Belly Guardian, Hungry Jaws)

### Friend Capacity
*The more friends, the merrier~ I’m nowhere near full just yet~* Your relationship with your allies transcends boundaries; you can eat any number of allies whose size equal to your average capacity without hindering your movement in the slightest, but eating above your average capacity will cause movement penalties to return. You can also eat up to 5x your total capacity of allies while still following the Capacity chart. (Prereq: Belly Guardian, Titan-stomach)

### Protective Hunger
*You need protection! And you need protection! And you need protection! And you need-* Because of your protective, hoarding nature, you get +1 free Actions to grapple and swallow an ally whole during your turn. (Prereq: Belly Guardian, nearby allies)

### The Belly Launcher
*It’s time to launch- all warriors are go!* Your immaculate control over insides allow you to squeeze your guts in such a way that you can launch whoever’s inside you out of your orifice in a targeted direction. With enemy prey, they must make a Test at Disadvantage; success means they can choose to either stay within the predator’s insides or fly out of the orifice without hitting any one in the direction of the launch in a 90 degree cone 15 feet away, while failure causing them to hit the first row of enemies they’re flung at for 1 damage. With ally prey, the prey must roll an attack roll at one category lower than what their combat prowess allows with a minimum of Disadvantage; success means they hit the target for 2 damage and land right in front of the target, but failure means they land beside or behind the attack target. (Prereq: Belly Guardian, filled belly)

### Swaying Guardian
*Whoa- no you don’t!* If an attack is directed at your ally inside you within close range, you may roll a Disadvantage test like you’re using the Evade Combat Action. This effect stacks with the Trait Agile. (Prereq: Belly Guardian, filled belly)

### Intimidating Hunger
*How does it feel to bask in my presence? Do you have the resolve to be eaten?* Using your proudly-standing form or some other pose to flaunt off your engorged organ as an Action, your predatory presence allows you to intimidate all enemies within a 20ft radius while you have someone inside of you, causing all targets within that radius to be shaken for 3 turns and roll at -1 Test; if they’re already rolling at Disadvantage, they must make a Disadvantage Morale save when attempting to attack, failure cancelling out the attempt to attack while success lets them attempt an attack roll at Disadvantage like normal. (Prereq: Belly Guardian, Strong Stance, filled/big belly)

### Belly Combo
*They can do more than just sit inside me! Hiyah!* While someone is inside you, you can use that engorged organ to assault your enemy. When an enemy is inside you when you attack, roll Standard to hit; if the attack’s successful both enemies inside and out of you take 1 damage while a fail means neither take damage. When an ally is inside you when you attack, roll Standard to hit### Advantage if they have Unarmed Proficiency; if the attack is successful, the target takes 2 damage while a fail means you both miss.  (Prereq: Belly Guardian, filled belly)

### Rending Grapple
*Stop using that stuff- it’s annoying!* Grabbing onto your opponent with either a limb or an orifice, you attempt to fling them about in hopes they lose their armour or weapons; roll a test to grapple, then make a second test at Disadvantage if you’re smaller than the target, Standard if equal, and Advantage if larger. If the second roll is a success, you throw them 5ft away from you in any direction then knock the target’s weapon 10ft away from them; if they don’t have a weapon but still have armour, remove that instead; if they have neither armour or a weapon, you can choose to either Throw them 5ft away from you for 1 damage or Slam them into the floor for 3 damage and set them prone. (Prereq: Belly Guardian)

### Predatory Pin
*You and your friends aren’t going anywhere!* If your character has a belly equal to their own size/has enough prey inside themselves to equal their size’s average capacity, they can use this Action to pin +1 target to the floor/wall with your gut/organ, leaving them Pinned while rendering you Immobile while on top/against them and dealing 1 damage. Pinned characters can’t move or attack and the only way to escape the status is if the predator either gets off/away from them, or they manage to succeed a Test to escape; smaller targets getting Disadvantage while bigger targets get advantage. (Prereq: Belly Guardian, filled/big belly)

### Aspect of the Guardian
*That didn’t hurt me in the slightest. Now, come at me### give me all you got!* As a Combat Action, you give up the ability to attack in exchange for absolute nullification against physical and force attacks, still vulnerable to magic and enchanted attacks, but you’re still allowed to move, grapple, throw, and block attacks for allies if you have a Trait to do so. You are still vulnerable to all types of attacks inside of you though. (Prereq: Belly Guardian, all Belly Guardian Class Skills, Strong Stance)


## P.I.A. (Personal Internal Assistant) (Class Trait)
*You thought you were alone inside these guts but there’s also I, (Insert Character name here)!!!* At the start of each rest, choose an ally within your party. You’re able to climb in and out of your designated Predator’s orifice(s) without deterring them physically, gaining the ability to clamber all about their insides and peep themselves out partially out from their orifice to provide assistance through the usage of weapons, equipment, and items. When attempting to attack an enemy within a predator’s stomach, you roll at Standard instead of Disadvantage.
### Enhanced Ingestion-Aid
*There ya go### this’ll help you with all of those aches and pains~* As a free action, you gain the ability to use healing or buffing items on your predator for free by pouring it down/around their insides and giving them rubs inside/outside of them. If the predator is currently in the midst of digestion/damaging a target within themselves, during your turn, you can choose to use a Combat Action to knead and rub over their body to help with the digestion/damage process, increasing damage taken by +1.

### Internal Guardian
*You will not harm my gut-hut, heathen! Have at you!!* Depending upon the direction of the orifice you’re within, you can prepare a Combat Action on your turn to protect your predator from harm; using a Light weapon or a Shield, you can choose at any point of your enemy(ies) turn to pop out partially from your predator’s orifice to deflect physical attacks/block small magical attacks at Disadvantage. Attacks too big or too many to block are instead reduced in damage by 1. Once you’re partially sticking out of the orifice, you’ll become vulnerable to attacks again until your turn where you can choose to dive back into your predator or wait for them to gulp you down as you continue to stick out and perform actions/attacks within your range.

### External-Sense Training
*My prey-senses are tingling- there’s a man hiding around the corner 50 yards away in a box holding a silenced glock and a cigarette!* Your experiences and skills with sensing approaching predators or prey have allowed you to both identify what a target’s vorish preference is even if they’re not into vore or the concept, and any nearby presence that’s making itself known to the predator. This Trait also allows you to roll Internal Guardian rolls to protect your predator at Standard.

### Internal-Combat Expertise
*You’re a weakling if being in a stomach inhibits your abilities. I mean seriously### doesn’t it feel great in here?* With your careful attention and combat prowess, you’re able to add your Proficiencies and Mastery to your Light Weapons, Unarmed Strikes, Improvised Weapons, and Magic Rolls while avoiding harming your predator on accident on failed attack rolls.

### Gastro Mage Expertise
*I’m gonna cast magic in here, and NOBODY IS GONNA STOP ME!!!* When you realize that you could use your feet and other limbs to stop a predator from preventing you from casting magic, it’s become SIGNIFICANTLY easier to cast magic without being stopped with rolls made inside an enemy stomach to cast magic now being rolled as normal.

### Preyish Assistance
*Get in here- the acid’s fine!~* When a prey is attempting to escape a predator’s stomach, you can either choose to assist them or inhibit their escape; roll a Disadvantage check to see if you help them escape, hold them back, or just bump into the predator’s guts and achieve nothing. This Trait works on both enemy and ally predators while inside or outside them.

### The Healing 
*Insert semi-obscure Operation Game music here.* For whatever reason you’ve discovered you’ve gained the ability to heal your allies better at the expense of your own health; when using a Combat Action to heal an ally or use items to heal/buff an ally you heal them for +2 points of HP or buff them for 1 turn longer than normal in exchange for 2HP. When performing a check to cure someone of a disease, fix a minor disability, or even perform an actual medical operation, in exchange for 2HP per-test, the user slows down time and stops the patient from dying while converting all rolls to Advantage.

### The Ultimate Healing Touch
*I will not allow this fate to come to fruition!* You’ve learnt how to use your Healing Touch combatively against your opponents; as a Combat Action, your body goes into hyper-focus and are able to automatically dodge all non-AOE attacks for 1 turn. If you decide to use The Ultimate Healing Touch, use all but 1 point of Health to freeze time and gain +1 Combat Action for every 9 points of HP spent to use the ability; no attack can miss during this duration, and any form of regeneration cannot prevent or heal the damage caused by the attack if it’s a creature who’s born with the ability to regenerate.

### Lasso Expert
*This seemed a lot easier in the movies….* Using a Whip or a Rope with a Honda Knot, you launch it towards a prey outside or inside a predator within 15ft and pull them towards you with a Disadvantage test; if the lasso or whip grabs its intended target, make a contesting Standard test against each other, with more successes leading to the winner of the Test; equal successes means you roll the Test again, the rope-holder winning means they pull a prey into/out of a pred, and the predator winning means they gain the opportunity to swallow the rope-holder with a Disadvantage check.

### The Belly Armoury Master
*What kind of weapon do you need? I got maces, knives, daggers, shortswords, longswords, axes, battle axes, a revolver, a-* Your desire to hoard weapons for its future uses has come in very handy as you put special covers around your weapons so that they can be stuffed down into your predator with you, allowing you to pass your weapons back out to your predator in their time of need when in need of different equipment that suits the situation. You can only stuff weapons into your predator that can be fully encapsulated by their guts without sticking out of them. They cannot swallow weapons during combat.

### The Caretaker
*I will take care of you to the best of my abilities.* Your gentle aura has not only infected your allies but your enemies as well; all allies within your presence gain +1 HP from healing, roll at +1 against Tests that affect a person’s will/mind, and provide them 1 Temp. HP per turn; all enemies within your presence receive -1 HP from healing roll at -1 against Tests that affect a person’s will/mind, and deal 1 less total damage to all allies minus you with a minimum of 1.

How does it feel to be thrown around by a superior fighter? Humiliating, ain’t it?

If they’re still alive, roll Standard to Taunt the target, but if they’re dead/unconscious, roll Advantage to Taunt all enemies within ear-shot.
