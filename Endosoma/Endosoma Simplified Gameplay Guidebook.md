#Endosoma #TinyDungeons6 
This is a simplified Guidebook of how to play Tiny Dungeons 2 and Endosoma by Fujiwara Takuya. Complex booklet's here: [Endosoma Detailed Gameplay Guidebook](Endosoma%20Detailed%20Gameplay%20Guidebook.md#), and other links here: [Endosoma TD6 Links](Endosoma%20TD6%20Links.md#)


# What is Endosoma? Simplified
A TTRPG-inspired System where most of the game is simple, played with D6 dice, and attempts to invite creativity in situations of mechanics and gameplay- an attempt to unleash your imagination and explore a world of fictional wonder and terror.

### Prologue
You've been given an opportunity to visit a brand new world fit for adventure and exploration; you can treat the world as a game, or believe the moral complications your actions hold in this new dimension and the people that reside within it.

### How to play?
You'll need the many Booklets, Guidebooks, and References to give yourself a better understanding of how everything works, but generally you'll only be needing to look through other Booklets if this Guidebook advises you to, so don't fret if you feel like you're gonna be swamped with too much information at once- both this and the detailed book attempt to simplify that.

First things first, you're going to need the following:
- The Tiny Dungeons 6 Second Edition Rulebook (Optional; https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xg0bx2-zdZa7hcUbpMyGUYXD4HwMaWXA/view?usp=sharing)
- An account on Roll 20 or a Google Sheets-friendly TD6 Character Sheet ([Tiny Dungeons Template (Based on TD6 version)](Tiny%20Dungeons%20Template%20(Based%20on%20TD6%20version).md#) or you can create your own based on it)
- The ability to ask for help if you're having trouble understanding what something means.

If you're able to at least get/use 2 of the 3 things up above, you should be able to play this system without much trouble. If ya can't, do please give your DM some consideration for doing some stuff for you if you still want to play the game but you can't use a PC or Roll20 or something.

Endosoma is an Open World TTRPG System that can work for a Traditional D&D campaign if you'd rather not play a typical D&D session of main quests one after another, or if this is your first time learning a TTRPG.

The main features include exploring an expansive world, TONS of side quests varying in length and difficulty, worthwhile and constant experience gain, and a near-endless exploration of an ever-growing world born from...something.

Vore is optional, you can gain pets, create your own weapons, armour, and equipment, enchant your gear, create jobs and/or buildings, become a Hero, become a Villain, and more! All you need to do is ask, and hope the DM is alright with it.

# Character Creation Simplified

This guide mainly covers Vanilla and Endosoma Character Creation, which is done in 2 parts, starting with Vanilla Character Creation before moving on to Endosoma content.
## Vanilla Tiny Dungeons Content
This is the Base-Game content for Tiny Dungeons on how to make a character.
### 1a: Who is your character?
For the sake of the campaign, your character is a being born from a different dimension to this one and being brought into it with the promise of wealth, power, and experiences that you may be seeking- with very little risk, and a whole ton of rewards.

All you need to do is give your character a Name, identify their People (Race), Homeland (Dimension/Place of existence/birth), Age, Eye Colour, Hair Colour, Family Trade (Job), and Belief (Personal Philosophy/Alignment); you ignore Heritage for now, and it's highly recommended to use your/a Fursona/Persona/Identity to hopefully immerse yourself better into the experience. These details are fairly minor, but depending upon the active background certain character traits can bring you benefits or disadvantages to certain rolls; if you're a cook, instead of making cooking Tests at Disadvantage, it could be rolled at Standard or Advantage.

### 1b: Choosing your Size, Weight, and Starting HP
From the [Endosoma Size and Weight Character Stuff](Endosoma%20Size%20and%20Weight%20Character%20Stuff.md#) page, your Character's size and weight will generally affect your ability to interact with the world and its environment.

All character are highly recommended to play Medium-sized characters for the sake of gameplay, but generally creatures of 1 size-category larger or smaller are also acceptable; any bigger or smaller will be up to your DM's discretion as to what is and isn't allowed.

Once you've selected a Size for your character, you'll want to copy the following to your Sheet as a Trait looking like this:

**Size: Category**
Size (Height, Weight, HP)

### 1c: Picking your Heritage
Normally, with the TD6 system, your Heritage is the same as selecting your Race in normal TTRPGs which also entitle you to to certain Racial Traits, but if you're making a custom character (and most likely you are), the Heritage section allows you to choose one pre-existing Trait available within the TD6 Booklet's Trait List.

If you want a different Trait that isn't listed on the Trait listing, feel free to check the [Endosoma TD6 Trait Listing](Endosoma%20TD6%20Trait%20Listing.md#); if you want a custom Heritage Trait, discuss the engagement and function with your DM.

After you've chosen your desired Heritage Trait, you put it into the Heritage section of your Character Sheet whilst also being able to use it as a form of Bio to explain your character's backstory and reasoning for their Trait.

### 1d: Picking your starting Traits
If you're playing with the Vanilla TD6 system with pre-made species, you usually don't pick a Trait at the start of the game unless the DM allows you a singular Trait for character creation. If you're making a custom race for your character, your custom race will always be given 3 Traits to define themselves with from the Trait List on page 33, 70, 74, 77, and 83 of the TD6 PDF.

These Traits once chosen are placed in the Trait-section of your character sheet for more obvious reading and understanding.

Do be wary that some Traits require a prerequisite- a selection of other Traits to be gained before you can select a certain Trait of your choosing.

### 1e: Picking your Proficiencies
With your character being set up for adventuring, your character will have some proficiency with fighting with a specific weight and style of combat: Light, Heavy, or Ranged.

When you choose a weapon category to be proficient with, instead of rolling that Test with with Disadvantage, you roll 1 Test category higher. If you don't have a Proficiency with a weapon or fighting style, you roll that Test at Disadvantage unless said otherwise.

### 1f: Picking your Weapon
After your choice in stats, traits, and abilities has been made, you choose a weapon that either fits your character's Proficiency, or a weapon that fits your character's Backstory. You can discuss with a DM what category a weapon fits into. Once you've chosen a weapon of choice, you add it to your sheet in the Equipped Items and Inventory Section with a Depletion Rating of 6, and if you see the 5 boxes in the middle with letters inside them, they relate to the weapon's Categories and what they fit into, to click on the boxes that your weapon fits into.

### 1g: Using Magic
Using Magic from Scrolls, Items, or on their surroundings, it requires you to have the Spell-Touched or Spell Reader Traits for your character, but if you want to use magic to a greater degree, including custom magic, it requires you to have the Archmage Prestige Trait.

Spell Reader allows you to read magic scrolls and use their effects when you desire.

Spell-Touched allows you to minorly influence your surroundings and shoot small bolts of magic; check the bottom of page 18 of the TD6 PDF for more details.

### 1h: Using Familiars and Animal Companions
When you gain a Familiar, you choose any one creature of Medium or smaller size for your spiritual companion to take the visage of, but depending on your DM, this visage can be bigger if they allow. This creature is incorporeal, meaning they can't touch or be touched by other things and can only communicate telepathically with their master; as long as they're within a 50ft-radius of their master, they can remain manifested until leaving that radius or taking 1 Magic Damage because they only have 1HP. When a Familiar is damaged and defeated, the master takes 1 point of damage. Summoning or unsummoning a familiar is considered a free Action and does not require a Test or an Action to perform, and when summoned, the familiar will appear on or within 5ft of their master.

When gaining an Animal Companion as an Archdruid, they choose an Animal Type from page 73 (It must be an animal and not a Monster), give them 2 Player Traits, and must make sure that their animal companion is not allowed to have access to magic or Adventurer-specific abilities

### 1i: Mounting
To Mount an allied creature inside of combat, it requires an Action with a Standard Test to successfully mount them, and to dismount is a Free Action. When outside of combat, a Test isn't required to mount.

A creature is only Mountable if they're 1 size-category larger or more to be considered safely Mountable, with creatures of equal-size being unsafe and requiring a Disadvantage Test at the start of each turn to remain Mounted or fall off them; any creature 1 size-category smaller than you is physically incapable of being Mountable unless they have a Trait that says otherwise.

When riding a Mount at the start of combat, you and your mount share your Initiative together, but if you Mount an allied creature in-combat instead, their Initiative is brought up or down to yours whilst remaining 1 underneath your own when separated.

### 1j: Experience Points
Experience is gained gradually over the course of the campaign you'll be playing, but instead of a typical Level System most of you might be familiar with, instead this game uses a Point-Buy system, where you use the available given Experience to Buy aspects to your growth, such as more HP, new Proficiencies or Mastery over a Weapon you hold or have interest in, or more Traits.

- +1 Max HP - 6 Experience Points
- Proficiency or Mastery of a Weapon - 8 Experience Points
- New Trait - 10 Experience Points

Note that to Master a weapon, one must have Proficiency with it, and EXP costs for certain Traits may vary depending upon its effects.

## Endosoma Content
This is the Homebrew Content made by Fuji which is based and adds on to Tiny Dungeons.

These steps come after creating your Character with the TD6 System up above.
### 2a: Endosoma's Class System
Endosoma enables players to feel unique and interesting by giving them the ability to Tri-Multiclass from a massive list of classes, subclasses, and different Traits which can affect their abilities in gameplay while attempting to make any classes played feel valued and enjoyable.

Players choose a Primary Class to play with from the [Classes](Classes.md#) page of the Endosoma Content, but as they play more of the game, they can spend their EXP to gain a Secondary and Tertiary Class; when spending Experience for new Traits, Secondary Classes require 1.5x the EXP cost to gain new Traits, while Tertiary Classes require 2x the EXP cost. Outside of these costs, not much from the classes are inhibited, and be wary these Traits can cost more than non-Endosoma Traits.

At the start of the game, each Class comes with their own Class Ability that comes free with choosing a Class, and 1 free Class Trait that the Player can take with the Class, but any additional Class Traits require EXP in to gain more Traits.

Once Players have chosen their Classes, they add the Class's text to the player's Trait List like so:

	(Class name) [Class]
	(Class Description)

To help with organisation, add the Class's Class Traits underneath it to help you figure out which class certain Traits came from; if you need to manually re-order Traits, you just go to the bottom of the List and press Modify to either remove or Move Traits from/across your List on Roll20.

#### Additional Class-work
Later, when the Player wishes to experiment with more Classes, Respec (Re-Specialize), or change Class Focus-Order (Switch Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary Class Positions), players can find a Class Trainer to perform any of the above-mentioned tasks for a sum-equivalent in Gold or Platinum Pieces.

When learning new Classes, they'll be expensive, but can be a worthy investment for later on, but as you're only physically capable of remembering and maintaining 3 Classes worth of teachings and learnings during Combat and daily activities, you can temporarily put one of your class's teachings aside to make room for a new Class while freely changing your Class Focus-Order based on which Class you'd like to learn next/have as your Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary Class. While a new Class is enabled in place of an old Class, the teachings aren't lost as they are temporarily disabled- including the Traits that came with it unless specified otherwise.

Respec-ing is simple; for a sum price, you can repurpose any spent EXP in any Class, Trait, Proficiency, Mastery, or HP and make use of it elsewhere, be it another Class, Trait, Proficiency, master, or HP. None of the EXP is lost, and any remaining leftover is unspent and can be used later for future use if you didn't like your prior choices in spending.

Changing your Class Focus-Order is basically choosing which Class you have to be your Primary, Secondary, or Tertiary Class so you can affect EXP spending or change out Classes between each other in position or usage if you have 2 or more Classes. Any Class not activated as a Primary, Secondary, or Tertiary Class will remain disabled along with its connected Class Traits unless mentioned otherwise.

### 2b: Fuji's Vore System for Tiny Dungeons
This is an explanation on how to Vore People with the Endosoma System and/or the Vore System on its own with Vanilla Gameplay.

All vore made with an ally or an enemy is automatically assumed to be Endo unless stated otherwise; 

Attempting to eat people comes in 3 phases: **Grapple, Devour, and Swallow**. Each Action requires an Action Point to perform, requires a Disadvantage Test on all rolls normally, and must be performed in the above specified order unless specified otherwise. There are certain Traits that can improve these abilities, inside and outside of the Endosoma System.

You can only make a Devour attempt on a Grappled or Helpless Target, leaving them inside your maw/orifice; Ranged and Magic Attacks for both Parties are at Disadvantage, but Ranged and Magic Attacks at the Pred are at -1 Category, with Melee being unaffected. Multiple Preds can make a Devour attempt on a Target, but only 1 is allowed to Swallow, leading to a Combat of Advantage Tests; winner Swallowing the Target.

When a Swallow attempt is made against a Devour Target, they're attempting to send them down to their belly/other organ for holding. When swallowed, the Target is immediately sent down into the Predator's guts and takes 1 Damage from their surroundings and impact; upon the start of the Target's turn, they immediately take 1 Damage from their Surroundings before, aside from normal Actions aside from Movement that can be taken, are able to do one of the following as reference:
- Try to escape their environment - Performing 2 consecutive Disadvantage Tests, if the 1st Test succeeds, they escape to the orifice that swallowed them in the first place, with the 2nd helping them achieve their escape from the Predator and continue with their turn if they have any remaining Actions. This act counts as 1 Action.
- Defeat their predator from the inside - Using their Attack Rolls like normal, while not managing to inflict permanent or long-standing harm to the Predator's insides unless ruled otherwise, the Target can inflict enough damage to either force the Pred to Succumb to their wounds or force them to remove the Target from their guts to avoid further injury.
- Attempt to inflict Discomfort upon their Predator's insides - If not capable of dealing proper harm or enough to defeat a Predator, you can instead cause Indigestion using a Disadvantage Test; if successful, the Predator must make a Disadvantage Test to overcome the queasiness or release their held captor and take -1 Action on their next Turn. If the Target fails to cause Discomfort to the Predator, it instead causes them Comfort and increases the Damage taken by anyone inside of the Predator by +1 for 3 turns; if this Action is used again and fails, the effect of Comfort Stacks and resets the duration of the effect.

When attempting to escape a Grapple or Devour, only 1 Disadvantage Test is needed to escape the Predator, but when attempting to escape after being Swallowed, 2 Consecutive Disadvantage Tests are required to succeed the escape; if you only only succeed with the 1st Test, you remain entrapped within the Predator's orifice but can become the target of Attacks, Items, and Spells directed your way.

If a Target is Willing to be eaten, a Pred may skip the need to Grapple, Devour, and Swallow a Target unless they're being Grappled by an enemy Target; any Unwilling Targets must require tests to be performed against them.
### 2c: Creativity Enhanced
This is a function implemented by Fuji as a way of rewarding fun, cool, interesting, weird, wacky, or insane Actions inside and outside of Combat, dubbed "The Creative Action". While regular Actions  that a Player can perform only require 1 Action to perform and are pre-defined acts made by the game, a Creative Action enables one to perform a complex set of manoeuvres that can technically take up 2-3+ Actions using only 2 Actions during gameplay- of course, the actions taken must be reasonable within the gameplay of the system; if a DM allows you to perform your Creative Action, you'll be required to roll a Disadvantage Test for each Action-equivalent manoeuvre is made, with success or failure being determined by the greater number of successes and fails, with ties resulting in comparisons via rolled numbers and any necessary rerolls.

In short, Creative Actions cost 2 Actions to perform, can be performed in and out of combat, and depending on the desired outcome, a number of Disadvantage Tests are required to be taken depending on how demanding the task being performed is. They generally allow you to perform stuff that can't be more-commonly produced in 3-6 seconds with simpler actions which only require 1 Action.


## Pokemon Content
This is the Homebrew Pokemon Content made by Fuji; doesn't need any more explanation further than this otherwise I'm probably gonna risk being Copyright Strike'd despite this being fan content by one guy.

The following steps are instructions for additions after making your Character's base; if you want the full set of instructions, head to [Pokemon TD6 Booklet](Pokemon%20TD6%20Booklet.md#)
### 3a: Choose your Pokemon's Heritage Trait
Pokemon have a list of 3 Heritage Traits they choose to take when they're first created:
- **Feral -** _You teach me and I'll teach you! POKEMOOOON!!_ As a natural Pokemon, you don't understand how to use regular tools or weaponry, but as long as an object's simple enough for them to wield, they can still use it as a weapon. **Feral Pokemon cannot use regular weaponry outside of Improvised and Unarmed Strike Attacks, and also have Proficiency over Unarmed Strike Attacks. Also, your Character's Size can either be based off of Character Creation, or the Pokemon's Average Size up to a size limit based off the Pokepedia page.** **Finally, like other Pokemon, you have elemental resistances and weaknesses while also being affected by certain weathered/elemental environments.**

- **Anthropomorphic -** _Pokemon! Pocket Monsters! Pokemon are the champions!_ While looking somewhat like any other Feral Pokemon, you seem to have a level of intelligence that surpasses normal Pokemon, giving you the ability to speak languages from another species, and even wield basic Melee weapons based upon your size. **Anthro Pokemon can use Light Weapons if they're Medium or smaller-sized, while Large-Very Large Anthros can use Heavy Weapons. Also, your Character's Size can either be based off of Character Creation, or the Pokemon's Average Size up to a size limit based off the Pokepedia page.** **Finally, like other Pokemon, you have elemental resistances and weaknesses while also being affected by certain weathered/elemental environments.**

- **Furryfied -** _[Insert Pokemon name] is one of the most suitable Pokemon for se-_ You're one of the unnaturally-built Pokemon in terms that you look more like an over/under-sized human with a Pokemon's head and tail- maybe even having tauric/naga-like aspects to your form. **Furryfied Pokemon are capable of using 1 additional category of weaponry with Proficiency and 1 additional Mastery over a weapon. Also, your Character's Size can either be based off of Character Creation, or the Pokemon's Average Size up to a size limit based off the Pokepedia page. Finally, like other Pokemon, you have elemental resistances and weaknesses while also being affected by certain weathered/elemental environments.**

### 3b: Choose Pokemon Traits
If you've already selected Traits from the Tiny Dungeons and/or Endosoma list, but have yet to check the Pokemon list, try surveying through the Pokemon Trait list for anything that interests you or would be helpful that you could replace from your available Traits.
### 3c: Add your Pokemon's Strengths and Weaknesses
At the bottom of the Heritage Trait, you list your Pokemon's Strength's and Weaknesses to damage-types, like so:
	Strengths: Fighting and Grass (x0.25), Poison, Bug, and Fairy (x0.5)
	Weaknesses: Flying, Rock, Fire, and Psychic (x2)
If a Pokemon is currently a Shadow Pokemon, above the normal Typings for the Pokemon, the following should be listed:
	 Currently a Shadow Pokemon!
	 Strengths: All Types
	 Weaknesses: None
	 Shadow Points: 

### 3d: Change Weapon Proficiencies and other details as needed with changes/additions to your Pokemon's Heritage Trait
Pokemon Heritage Traits have certain limitations/requirements to be active for it to function correctly; as long as they're selected properly and shown on your sheet, you can identify your Pokemon's current capabilities for combat and actions outside of combat.

# Combat Simplified
Here's the comprehensive list performable by Players during combat (Tiny Dungeons & Endosoma): 
- Move (1 Action) - Move up to 25ft; can be used 2 times.
- Sprint (2 Actions) -  Quickly dash up to 100ft.
- Attack (1 Action) - Perform an Attack within your Range.
- Reload (1 Action (Ranged Weapons)) - Reload Projectile for ranged weapon.
- Dodge (1 Action) - Use an Action to become more evasive until your next turn.
- Use/hold/stow away Item in hand from/to Inventory/Range/area (1 Action) - Use an Object/Item/Interactable item within 5ft, or hold it.
- Throw held thing (1 Action) - Throw a thing in your hand(s) up to 30ft.
- Grapple (1 Action) - Bind something down with your reach to hold it in place.
- Use Trait (1-2 Action(s)) - Use a Trait's effect/attack upon a chosen Target.
- Creative Action (2 Actions) - Do something not listed up above and allowed by the DM if performable.
### Weapon Categories and usages
There are different types of weapons which are simply categorized as Light, Heavy, or Ranged weapons, but each one comes with special benefits to their equipment and usage.

Light Weapons are one-handed that a one can reach 5ft around you and can enable you to use other one-handed items like a shield, potion, book, scroll, other one-handed weapons, and more.

Heavy weapons require 2 hands to wield meaning you can't use items while using one, but have the benefit of reaching 10ft away from the user (usually), and dealing 1 extra damage. The only way to use other items while wielding a Heavy weapon is using a Free Action to drop a weapon from one of your hands or temporarily rest the weapon against yourself to free up your other hand; if you wish to re-equip the weapon again, it requires an Action to wield the weapon again while in combat.

Ranged weapons can be like Light or Heavy weapons but 2-handed Ranged weapons don't benefit from increased damage or range; all Ranged weapons have a a 30ft-radius attack range but can fire further than their given attack range in exchange for rolling at -1 Test category per-range-increment up to a maximum of 3 increments/90ft. 2-handed Ranged weapons also require you to free up one hand in order to use items with your free hand, and an Action to re-equip the item properly for combat. After firing a Ranged weapon once, it requires you to spend an Action to properly reload your weapon for its next usage unless something says otherwise about the weapon.
