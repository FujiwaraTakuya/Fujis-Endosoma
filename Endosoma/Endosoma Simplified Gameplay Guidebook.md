#Endosoma #TinyDungeons6 
This is a simplified Guidebook of how to play Tiny Dungeons 2 and Endosoma by Fujiwara Takuya. Complex booklet's here: [Endosoma Detailed Gameplay Guidebook](Endosoma%20Detailed%20Gameplay%20Guidebook.md#), and other links here: [Endosoma TD6 Links](Endosoma%20TD6%20Links.md#)


# What is Endosoma?
A TTRPG-inspired System where most of the game is simple, played with D6 dice, and attempts to invite creativity in situations of mechanics and gameplay- an attempt to unleash your imagination and explore a world of fictional wonder and terror.

## Prologue


## How to play?
You'll need the many Booklets, Guidebooks, and References to give yourself a better understanding of how everything works, but generally you'll only be needing to look through other Booklets if this Guidebook advises you to, so don't fret if you feel like you're gonna be swamped with too much information at once- both this and the detailed book attempt to simplify that.

First things first, you're going to need the following:
- The Tiny Dungeons 6 Second Edition Rulebook (Optional; https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xg0bx2-zdZa7hcUbpMyGUYXD4HwMaWXA/view?usp=sharing)
- An account on Roll 20 or a Google Sheets-friendly TD6 Character Sheet (I don't have any references for the Google Sheets one so if you find or make one, good on ya!)
- The ability to ask for help if you're having trouble understanding what something means.

If you're able to at least get/use 2 of the 3 things up above, you should be able to play this system without much trouble. If ya can't, do please give your DM some consideration for doing some stuff for you if you still want to play the game but you can't use a PC or Roll20 or something.

# Character Creation

### 1a: Who is your character?
For the sake of the campaign, your character is a being born from a different dimension to this one and being brought into it with the promise of wealth, power, and experiences that you may be seeking- with very little risk, and a whole ton of rewards.

All you need to do is give your character a Name, identify their People (Race), Homeland (Dimension/Place of existence/birth), Age, Eye Colour, Hair Colour, Family Trade (Job), and Belief (Personal Philosophy/Alignment); you ignore Heritage for now, and it's highly recommended to use your/a Fursona/Persona/Identity to hopefully immerse yourself better into the experience. These details are fairly minor, but depending upon the active background certain character traits can bring you benefits or disadvantages to certain rolls; if you're a cook, instead of making cooking Tests at Disadvantage, it could be rolled at Standard or Advantage.
