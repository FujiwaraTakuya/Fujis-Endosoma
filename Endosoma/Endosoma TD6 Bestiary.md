#Endosoma #TinyDungeons6 
Welcome to the giant-ass Bestiary being written by Fujiwara Takuya. I’m being hella-informal about this because I’m writing things as I come up with them, and this information’s mostly for the GM’s expense. Feel free to use these species, ideas, and random-ish ideas as a reference guide for creating your own homebrew monsters, otherworldly beings, and general opponents to combat.

(Feral Hare)

(HP Average)

1-4

  

(Unique Trait(s))

- Reflexive Attention (Can only perform 1 Attack Action per-Round; must attack .)
    

  

(Special Attacks)

- Sharp Bite (Melee Range; Disadvantage Test; 1Dmg)
    
- Savage Takedown (Melee Range; Disadvantage Test; 1Dmg for each successful roll if grapple succeeds) (3 or more Feral Hares surround a Target; all use an Action to attempt grapple during Round; upon activation, all Hares leap at a Target with d6, with 2 successes out of the total on a Medium Target Proning the Target; Success Requirements increase by +1 for each size category bigger the Target is, and rolls only succeed on a 6.)
    

  

(Gender rate (M/F))

65%/35%

  

(Breeding rate)

2-8 times per-year during Autumn, with a 40% survival rate per year.

  

(Size Average)

1-2ft

  

(Size Category Average)

Tiny

  

(General Bio)

Despite having a mere appearance of a regular Hare, this species differentiates from it's 'tame' counterpart with a more omnivorous diet that, while still greatly preferring nutrients from vegetation and general plantlife, can opt to hunt for greater sources of protein and calcium from mammals and fish if the situation is deemed necessary. Can usually be seen in smaller hunting packs of 3 or more, with average numbers of colonies varying from 10-50+ as some Naturists (Botany) have described while being chased down by hordes of Feral Hares.

  

(Food Bio)

Their white meat can become stringy and dry if improperly prepared, with proper preparation causing the meat to become light, tender, and lightly juicy with or without the skin on, tasting a bit like chicken but with a earthier, meatier taste; its dark meat's usually non-existant unless you manage to find them during the Autumn or Winter times, but any found tend to be drastically juicer and have a deeper, savoury flavour than the average Hare.

(Jiggi-jiggi Slime)

(HP Average)

2-6

  

(Unique Trait(s))

- Weak Physical Immunity (This creature can avoid physical attacks between 1-3Dmg with a Disadvantage Test that only succeeds on a 6 after taking damage.)
    
- Weak Physicality (Must spend 1 turn charging every attack they perform unless attached to the Target it's attacking.)
    
- Slime Swarm-spawn (Upon death, perform a Disadvantage Test; if the slime suceeds, roll a d4, with the result being a total number of Mini-Jiggi-Jiggi Slimes being spawned. Each Mini-Jiggi-Jiggi Slime has 1HP, does not retain the 'Slime Swarm-spawn' trait 'til 1 year after their birth, and has access to all Attacks its predecessor had at -1Dmg.)
    

  

(Attack(s))

- Slime Tackle (10ft Range; Standard Test; jumps into Melee for `1Dmg)
    
- Slime Slam (Melee Range; Standard Test; 1Dmg, attempts to pin with Disadvantage Test against creatures of equal or smaller size)
    
- Slime Grab (Melee Range; Standard Test; User performs a Standard Test to attach itself to a Target and enable it to attack without charging.)
    

- Sizzlesizzle (Melee/Attached Range; 1Dmg/2Dmg if the user is attached to the Target it's attacking)
    

  

(Gender rate (M/F))

No assigned gender; simultaneously genderless and genderfluid *badum tsh*

  

(Breeding rate)

Asexual reproduction; has a chance to spawn 1-4 children upon death or slowly spawn 1-2 ‘children’ every month; 75% survival rate per year.

  

(Size Average)

1ft 9 Inches-2ft 6 Inches

  

(Size Category Average)

Tiny/Small

  

(General Bio)

A spherical-looking creature with an amorphous body that takes no natural shape other than a blob akin to a water droplet on leaves, with two beady eyes and what appears to be a circular and tougher core within its body that it can move about freely. A very commonly seen Monster, these mindless creatures tend to randomly exist around the pastures, lakes, trees- just about everywhere in the areas of Refariam slowly dissolving anything they deem 'consumable'; usually starting from parts of leaves, to rocks, then slow-moving insects. While some are able to evolve naturally through continual consumption of objects and organisms, some have been seen to roam to other areas outside of Refariam which may hypothetically lead to the strange yet possible relevance to other slime-based creatures within the other countries.

  

(Food Bio)

This race, even after death, will retain their general capability to dissolve and assimilate objects and organisms into its remaining body lasting from several minutes to over an hour before finally losing this effect and becoming completely safe for consumption; while generally unadvised, it's still somewhat okay to consume before this effect is over as the acidic enzymes that pass through its body aren't strong enough after death to cause fatal internal damage to the touch; these acidic enzymes hypothetically causing a sour taste akin to lemons and limes but with greater intensity that can cause pain to the tongue.

  

After the appropriate time-period has passed, all pieces from the slime will have lost the acidic enzyme within the body and thus now give its gelatinous body a light, gooey-yet-solid texture that a mere wooden spoon can cut through its surface yet remain whole and unbreaking. Without the enzyme, they have a bit more blander but light, faint, nuttier taste that didn't taste present beforehand, but with proper preparation, can lead to a delicious snack, sauce, or stew that can accompany a lot of dishes.

(Grau Gatto)

(HP Average)

1-2

  

(Unique Trait(s))

- Feline Intimidation (If the Gatto hasn’t been attacked on the first turn of Combat, or upon being first approached in a non-approachable manner, the Gatto attempts a Disadvantage Test against all enemies in line-of-sight to intimidate them and reduce their Movement Speed by -5ft for 3 turns. This effect can stack from each unique Gatto that applies this effect up to half of the Target’s total Original Movement Speed, resetting the duration in the progress.)
    
- Feline Maneuvers (If the Gatto is within 10ft of an Enemy space, the Gatto may opt to use this Trait to jump in 5ft and attack their target before jumping 5ft back.)
    

  

(Special Attacks)

- Lacerating slash (Melee Range; Standard Test; 1Dmg, Standard Test with only 6 success causing stack of Bleed for 1d6 rounds)
    
- Vicious Grau Bite (Melee Range; Disadvantage Test; 1Dmg)
    
- Gatto Bap-Bap (Melee range; Standard Test; 1Dmg per successful dice)
    
- Grau Feline dexterity (10ft Range; Standard Test; jumps into Melee for 2Dmg, then jumps back 10ft away)
    

  

(Gender rate (M/F))

On average there’s been discovered to be 1 male in every 3 females, sometimes no males whatsoever in multiple kindles, so the lack of a male Grau can lead to power disputes within colonies.

  

(Breeding rate)

Too young; don’t you dare creeps of the world; 40% survival rate per year.

  

(Size Average)

  
  

(Size Category Average)

Tiny

  

(General Bio)

A small fuzzy cat with a jagged, scruffy, stripe-patterned coat with features akin to a lion cub but with more fur, these adorable but cautious felines are pack hunters with quite lethal claws used for hunting; on their 3-toed paws, their middle toe conceals a tiny serrated tip used for inflicting lethal lacerations upon its prey that cause them to bleed. These kits remain small and young for about 4 years before spending a growth period over their 5th year that turns these kittens into adolescent killers with strong familial bonds. But don’t let their small size fool you as they can still deal quite a bit of harm to those unexpecting of it.

  
  

Due to their adorable looks, and strong bonds to those it connects to, these species of wild felines have been a target of interest in zoos and rich families wishing to have these beasts as pets and/or guard animals as they are quite effective in large packs and company.

(Grau Rioness)

(HP Average)

4-6

  

(Unique Trait(s))

- Feline Intimidation (If the Rioness hasn’t been attacked on the first turn of Combat, or upon being first approached in a non-approachable manner, the Rioness attempts a Disadvantage Test against all enemies in line-of-sight to intimidate them and reduce their Movement Speed by -10ft for 3 turns. This effect can stack from each unique Rioness that applies this effect up to half of the Target’s total Original Movement Speed, resetting the duration in the progress.)
    
- Feline Maneuvers (If the Gatto is within 10ft of an Enemy space, the Gatto may opt to use this Trait to jump in 5ft and attack their target before jumping 5ft back.)
    
- Pack Hunter (When within 20ft of another Rioness hunting the same Target, increase all Attack and Dodge Tests against that Target by 1 Category)
    

  

(Special Attacks)

- Lacerating Slash (Melee Range; Standard Test; 1Dmg, Standard Test with only 6 success causing stack of Bleed for 1d8 rounds)
    
- Vicious Grau Bite (Melee Range; Disadvantage Test; 2Dmg)
    
- Gatto Bap-Bap (Melee Range; Advantage Test; 1Dmg per successful dice)
    
- Rioness Feline dexterity (15ft Range; Standard Test; 2Dmg, then jumps back 15ft away)
    

  

(Gender rate (M/F))

33% chance of male in a kindle of 2-4 kits; Males are not designated as Rioness.

  

(Breeding rate)

70% success rate, with Heat lasting a whole month throughout Summer; 60% survival rate per year.

  

(Size Average)

  
  

(Size Category Average)

  
  

(General Bio)

An adult Female Grau Gatto, they’re the most hard-working members of the colony of Graus; hunting, protecting, and caring for their young while generally having a bit more of an active personality, but this doesn’t mean there aren’t any outliers. Some appear to be more lethargic, some more combative, even some quite powerful enough to explore, hunt, and even hunt for a mate on their own, but the latter is quite rare amongst larger colonies.

  

Having a short but fluffier coat than its child and adolescent counterparts, accented upon its joints with a curled, pointed tufts, with the tips of their tail being particularly jagged and pointy; standing around 4-5ft tall on all fours, they can be quite dangerous to deal with when in close proximity as their serrated claw is even bigger and sharper than before.

  

(Food Bio)

  

Their meat is both stringy and tough to chew through whilst maintaining a slightly sour flavour and a slightly bitter aftertaste. The more we chewed into their meat, the worse its gamey taste became- if we could even gall it gamey.  Have fun, chefs of the world.

(Huma-Huma Apis: Drone)

(HP Average)

3-5

  

(Unique Trait(s))

- Lightweight Flight (Due to their light frames and anatomy, despite how they look, these creatures can fly/hover near-effortlessly, meaning they naturally fly/hover about everywhere so they’ll generally avoid touching the floor unless tired or if they find it out of necessity, but due to this are much more susceptible to the pressures of wind and knockback)
    
- Insectoid Hive Tactics (While within 100ft of each other, a designated leader Drone hovers back while tactically commanding their allies from behind, unable to attack nearby entities whilst enhancing all drones’ Tests for Attack and Dodge Tests by 1 Category, also disabling their ability to move but still enabling them to Dodge incoming attacks.)
    
- Insectoid Nimbleness (The user is able to use the Dodge Action for free as long as it doesn’t attack twice or is immobilized; this Trait negates the Dodge Action’s ability to Dodge while Rooted)
    

  

(Special Attacks)

- Triple Thrust (Melee Range; 3 Disadvantage Tests; successful tests each deal 1 damage.)
    
- Infatuating Hum (10ft square around User; Disadvantage Test from non-Huma Huma Apis; inflicts the Infatuated status lasting for 1d6 rounds or until the Infatuated Target has been hit.)
    
- Aerial Advantage (Personal Range; Advantage Test; flies higher up into the air by 5ft, avoiding one-handed weapons not on the same height. When used before a non-special attack, for every 5ft of height and 30ft of distance consumed while reaching a target in a straight line increases the total damage by +1. Does not invoke Attacks of Opportunity.)
    

  

(Gender rate (M/F))

99.9% Male

  

(Breeding rate)

100% with the Queen; numbers unknown with alternate hosts; 99.5% survival rate every year.

  

(Size Average)

  
  

(Size Category Average)

  
  

(General Bio)

While these fuzzy creatures may look like a furry fey from a first glance, they are far from those beautiful-yet-terrifying creatures in terms of magical ability and generally threatening capability, but are still threatening enough to put your life in concern if you decide to mess with them. These large, 2ft-2ft 6 inches tall, anthropomorphic bees sport 4 arms, 2 legs, a sizable abdomen, 2 pairs of wings, and a fairly thick and fuzzy coat that is simultaneously thick and puffy while still being fairly short in length.

  

Drones can be identified by their size, shape, and general gear they’ll be wielding whilst out and about, but can also generally be identified if they are alone, in small somewhat disorganized groups, or appear to be on the lookout for something. Like their small counterparts, they were born to scout, look for new potential homes to stay within, and mate with old, new, or potential queens to continue the ever-growing cycle of repopulation. Due to their low status, however, barely any are able to escape their status as a Drone and thus, are generally fated to be cannon fodder for information-toting.

  

(Food Bio)

Being some of the less cared-for members, they aren’t fed as much while generally working mostly upon their teamwork skills and scouting tactics; this leads to them having less selectively more tender meat than the Workers. Their meat is so soft and juicy, you’d be surprised that the taste would be akin to a honey-infused or marinated chicken.

(Unique Trait(s))

- Undead Resistance - Due to their persistent nature, this undead creature reduces all Physical Damage taken by half to a minimum of 1 from single attacks.
    
- Magic HardWood - Because of their magic-infused body, their bark is notoriously tougher than the average bark on a tree; every time an enemy attacks the User with a Slashing/Piercing weapon/limb, they must then roll a Standard Test with successes only on 6s to avoid having their weapon; failure forces a weapon to get stuck in the User’s bark and require the owner of the weapon/limb to spend an Action to Test if they can pull their weapon out with a Disadvantage Test.
    
- Tree Resistances - Being part-tree, this creature takes -1 damage from water, electricity, earth, steel, and mythical sources, whilst taking +1 damage fire, ice, poison, and insectoid sources.
    

  

(Special Attacks)

- Rotting Root Whipping (Roll 1d2; for each success, make a Disadvantage Test against each target of choice; 2Dmg per-hit)
    
- Rotting Root Skewers (All enemies/non-allied creatures within 15ft; Disadvantage Test; 1Dmg per-hit)
    
- Rotting Root Restraints (Disadvantage Test for each Player within 15ft; Roots all failed Tests)
    
- Undead Screech (2 Disadvantage Tests; Target every creature within 30ft with the ability to hear/feel vibrations; 1st Test Dazes targets, 2nd Test deals 1Dmg)
    

  

(Gender rate (M/F))

Generally doesn’t identify with one because they don’t interact with common social norms, but even if they were to, it’s currently a walking tree-corpse zombie so this shouldn’t matter.

  

(Breeding rate)

Very dead; no way of producing any magical essence or control over it to heal or manipulate things outside of its own body; can’t create seeds or pollen to make use of its natural abilities after death.

  

(Size Average)

  
  

(Size Category Average)

  
  

(General Bio)

Once a growing tree given magical essence either by nature or outside influences, this tree once was a growing adolescent that’d only just managed to escape to adulthood, only to be felled by disease and malnourishment, or possibly having its life brought to a tragic end by a fierce warrior with an axe. With desperation and rage still instilled within its soul, if the roots of the tree haven’t been severed from the corpse or if the stump still remains after its death, the magical essence within its body erupts from within to forcibly sprout whatever energy it has left to regenerate itself into a half-finished broken tree, hobbling and wandering around like a disheveled corpse, attacking any small or larger creature within its sights.

  

(Food Bio)

It’s a rotting tree. Do not try eating unless you want a disease. Better as Ash because even leaving it alone could probably do harm to the environment.

- Rotting Root Spear (A Target within 10ft; Disadvantage Test; 1Dmg per-hit)
    
- Rotting Root Lasso (Disadvantage Test;Target a Player within 10ft; Roots failed Tests)
    

  

(Gender rate (M/F))

Also a zombie tree with no personality; not old enough to identify with one.

  

(Breeding rate)

Is as dead as its predecessor; no possibility for rebirth or growth.

  

(Size Average)

  
  

(Size Category Average)

  
  

(General Bio)

Either leftover seeds or never-pollinated, these seeds dramatically sprout out from the ground after absorbing the nearby nutrients and water from the earth to create these undead saplings forcing themselves to grow without the proper sustenance; lurching and crawling around to find anything to sustain its never-ending hungry. In most cases, purification/revival is beyond possibility.

  

(Food Bio)

Same as its predecessor; turn to ash for fertilizer or risk a high possibility of getting a disease.

- Green Goblin Resistances - When being attacked by Poison, Gas, or Medicinal-based attacks, they deal -1 damage to the point of total negation.
    
- Green Goblin Speciality - When attacking with Goblin-made Weapons or Poisons, they deal an additional +1 damage to susceptible creatures, while healing from Goblin-based medicines better by +1. 
    

  

(Special Attacks)

- Green Goblin Poison Darts (Limit 3 rounds per-outing; Disadvantage Test; 1Dmg + 1Dmg per-end of turn a Poisoned Target takes)
    
- Green Goblin Poultice (Melee Range; Disadvantage Test with success only on 6; heal a Target within range)
    
- Desperate Throwing (When grabbing and throwing nearby objects at a Target within 15ft, roll a Standard Test instead of Disadvantage; does not apply to thrown 2-handed weapons or heavy objects to your species)

(Size Category Average)

  
  

(General Bio)

A bipedal humanoid species roughly ranging between 2-3ft tall, having pointed ears, jagged teeth, irregularly-shaped noses in comparison to humans, and sometimes disproportionately-grown limbs; humanity’s shown these creatures an unfavorable view for decades, even for those who wish to integrate into the open society. Even with their appearance, personality, or even whole identities thrown heavily into infamy, some of their kind have been able to overwhelm the populace with an unknown kind nature which continues to baffle xenophobes to this day.

  

Some races of Goblin have been known to be found with green, red, white, purple, or black skin, with each having their own particular abilities, resistances, and capabilities, so it’s best not to lump them all into one corner, lest you find yourself overwhelmed by the true might of these fearsome beings.

  

(Food Bio)

Generally unethical, but based upon certain anonymous Goblins who were interviewed over their village’s history, some were able to vividly describe the taste as tight, (Cont.vvv) stringy, acid-bitter jerky that could only be mellowed out through boiling. Their organs were better-repurposed for medicinal uses outside of obvious organs used for meal-foods like sausages.

(General Bio)

While looking somewhat similar to their Goblin brethren but with darker or lighter skin, Hobgoblins are a special genus of Goblin born randomly amongst the populace, usually seen as a sign of either good luck, future fortune, or possibly a sign of growing strength for family as Hobgoblins are not only tougher than their Goblin ancestors, but faster, better-witted, and have a knack for unique trickery which confounds even some of the brightest minds into their traps and illusions. Be it evolution or some outside (Cont.vvv)  factor that influences this fact, we can’t say for certain, but a good number of Hobgoblins seem to share the same or similar trait for street smarts and trap-making, but these special genes aren’t always entirely positive or functional for all.

Again, unethical by general standards, but with prior interviews, supposably the stringiness, bitter acid, and tight meat is much less potent and instead almost seems to have a sweet or savory taste to it based upon the being’s appetite; appearing to have more appreciative softness to it akin to chicken.

These large or bigger beings are humanoid in shape but tremendously more thickly-muscled in design; sporting quite a lot of strength to them that should not be overlooked. While most are slow for their hulking size, usually attributed to their massive physiques built from heavy consumption of meat and bone, some appear to be much more agile than some of their other kind which can make them even more threatening when they can pack a similar punch in power. While a bit slow-witted, this doesn’t mean none of their kind can’t be intelligent enough to understand advanced knowledge such as science, astrology, or alchemy.

(General Bio)

While mostly an unseen creature to everyone who’s heard of its name, there have been documented sightings of this creature that none have really been able to properly confirm with evidence, but their general appearance has been almost been described point-to-point accurately amongst survivors of certain fates.

  

Standing 9ft-ish tall with an extremely lanky and almost famished-looking body, the length of their limbs disproportionately contradict its power and capabilities as those who’ve seen is visage describe it with its ribcage almost ready to tear through its chest, with their stomach cavity sunken to the point of almost visibility of their spine through the front; the bones between shoulder to elbow and forearm being longer than that of a human child’s height with fingers as stubby as a pebble upon the floor but that matters not to this cryptid as its 2ft-long claws bend and contort like dingers, creaking and cracking with each movement they make while slashing through flesh like a butcher’s knife through fresh meat and bone; standing on legs like jaguar but with giant humanoid feet sporting talons like an avian on the front and back of their feet.

  

Most don’t see their face if they’re ‘lucky’ as they can unhinge their jaws enough to fit a pumpkin inside, with the ‘unlucky’ ones appearing to meet only a terrifying fate as they bite, tear, and crunch through those they get their teeth upon until all that’s left is a bloodied, boney pulp of their bodies- at least, that’s what can be assumed based off the explanations and details given by those who heard their friends/relatives pass away to this ‘beast’.

  

As a shortened idea of what evidence was mentioned and given by the many victims: A 9ft tall, lanky, malnourished-looking humanoid with disproportionately-sized limbs, stubby fingers, cracking and creaking claws, jaguar-like legs, and a heavily violent and unorganized disposition.     

Some have described the creature having differing features to the more-commonly explained one, but those who’ve described these different visuals to them were almost unanimously voted from piers, friends, and family as some of the bravest people they knew, meaning its possible this creature has some form of shapeshifting ability or capable of releasing hallucinogens that confuse its prey while it’s on the hunt.

A 20-legged humanoid with a centipede-like lower body with a long, dark mane covering them from head to twin-pointed tail, these hellish, almost nightmarish-looking creatures with white skin, sunken eyes, constantly visible teeth and either yellow or bloodshot eyes that phase in and out of this dimension or reality act alone and never hunt for meals in groups.

  

These demented-looking beasts crawl and climb on any surface they can before leaping and lunging at people or creatures to cause them to jump or run away from their visage, never touching their prey yet always within reach as their presence is used for intimidation before forcing those who fear it and death to experience a gruesome death not directly caused by them in most cases; using their environment to torturously leave their victims at the brink of death before devouring their soul and phasing out of existence once more.

  

It’s been theorized these terrifying, shocking beasts roam around unpopulated areas around the world haunting or hunting lone beings or small, weak-minded creatures to scare and kill unsuspecting prey, with certain cases of courage and bravery seeming to drive off or be a form of repellant to these monsters as they always try to cause great pain and grief to an individual through physical efforts, yet never appearing to show any form of psychological warfare.
