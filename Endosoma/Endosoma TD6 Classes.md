## Gardien du Ventre (Belly Guardian) (Class Trait)
*My body is my shield, and my spear### you cannot deter either!* At the start of each day, depending upon the number of people who’ve spent their night within you, you gain +1 Temporary Health-Shield Points up to a maximum equal to the number of Traits you have. These can only be replenished once per day during the morning, last until the start of sleep or until you run out of Temp. HSP, and only if the people inside you have been inside since the start of your sleep.
### Thick Skin
*You’re so fat, despite being hit by that troll’s club, I barely felt a thing!* While having someone inside them, if an attack were directed towards someone within them, their body absorbs the blow of the attack for them, taking only 1 point of the total damage while any remaining goes to your ally. (Prereq: Belly Guardian, filled belly)

### Powerful Swallowing 
*Phew- any longer in that slime and I probably would’ve lost my pants.* Your internal muscles are so strong, you make all Tests to swallow your allies stuck in rough terrain at Standard. (Prereq: Belly Guardian, Hungry Jaws)

### Friend Capacity
*The more friends, the merrier~ I’m nowhere near full just yet~* Your relationship with your allies transcends boundaries; you can eat any number of allies whose size equal to your average capacity without hindering your movement in the slightest, but eating above your average capacity will cause movement penalties to return. You can also eat up to 5x your total capacity of allies while still following the Capacity chart. (Prereq: Belly Guardian, Titan-stomach)

### Protective Hunger
*You need protection! And you need protection! And you need protection! And you need-* Because of your protective, hoarding nature, you get +1 free Actions to grapple and swallow an ally whole during your turn. (Prereq: Belly Guardian, nearby allies)

### The Belly Launcher
*It’s time to launch- all warriors are go!* Your immaculate control over insides allow you to squeeze your guts in such a way that you can launch whoever’s inside you out of your orifice in a targeted direction. With enemy prey, they must make a Test at Disadvantage; success means they can choose to either stay within the predator’s insides or fly out of the orifice without hitting any one in the direction of the launch in a 90 degree cone 15 feet away, while failure causing them to hit the first row of enemies they’re flung at for 1 damage. With ally prey, the prey must roll an attack roll at one category lower than what their combat prowess allows with a minimum of Disadvantage; success means they hit the target for 2 damage and land right in front of the target, but failure means they land beside or behind the attack target. (Prereq: Belly Guardian, filled belly)

### Swaying Guardian
*Whoa- no you don’t!* If an attack is directed at your ally inside you within close range, you may roll a Disadvantage test like you’re using the Evade Combat Action. This effect stacks with the Trait Agile. (Prereq: Belly Guardian, filled belly)

### Intimidating Hunger
*How does it feel to bask in my presence? Do you have the resolve to be eaten?* Using your proudly-standing form or some other pose to flaunt off your engorged organ as an Action, your predatory presence allows you to intimidate all enemies within a 20ft radius while you have someone inside of you, causing all targets within that radius to be shaken for 3 turns and roll at -1 Test; if they’re already rolling at Disadvantage, they must make a Disadvantage Morale save when attempting to attack, failure cancelling out the attempt to attack while success lets them attempt an attack roll at Disadvantage like normal. (Prereq: Belly Guardian, Strong Stance, filled/big belly)

### Belly Combo
*They can do more than just sit inside me! Hiyah!* While someone is inside you, you can use that engorged organ to assault your enemy. When an enemy is inside you when you attack, roll Standard to hit; if the attack’s successful both enemies inside and out of you take 1 damage while a fail means neither take damage. When an ally is inside you when you attack, roll Standard to hit### Advantage if they have Unarmed Proficiency; if the attack is successful, the target takes 2 damage while a fail means you both miss.  (Prereq: Belly Guardian, filled belly)

### Rending Grapple
*Stop using that stuff- it’s annoying!* Grabbing onto your opponent with either a limb or an orifice, you attempt to fling them about in hopes they lose their armour or weapons; roll a test to grapple, then make a second test at Disadvantage if you’re smaller than the target, Standard if equal, and Advantage if larger. If the second roll is a success, you throw them 5ft away from you in any direction then knock the target’s weapon 10ft away from them; if they don’t have a weapon but still have armour, remove that instead; if they have neither armour or a weapon, you can choose to either Throw them 5ft away from you for 1 damage or Slam them into the floor for 3 damage and set them prone. (Prereq: Belly Guardian)

### Predatory Pin
*You and your friends aren’t going anywhere!* If your character has a belly equal to their own size/has enough prey inside themselves to equal their size’s average capacity, they can use this Action to pin +1 target to the floor/wall with your gut/organ, leaving them Pinned while rendering you Immobile while on top/against them and dealing 1 damage. Pinned characters can’t move or attack and the only way to escape the status is if the predator either gets off/away from them, or they manage to succeed a Test to escape; smaller targets getting Disadvantage while bigger targets get advantage. (Prereq: Belly Guardian, filled/big belly)

### Aspect of the Guardian
*That didn’t hurt me in the slightest. Now, come at me### give me all you got!* As a Combat Action, you give up the ability to attack in exchange for absolute nullification against physical and force attacks, still vulnerable to magic and enchanted attacks, but you’re still allowed to move, grapple, throw, and block attacks for allies if you have a Trait to do so. You are still vulnerable to all types of attacks inside of you though. (Prereq: Belly Guardian, all Belly Guardian Class Skills, Strong Stance)


## P.I.A. (Personal Internal Assistant) (Class Trait)
*You thought you were alone inside these guts but there’s also I, (Insert Character name here)!!!* At the start of each rest, choose an ally within your party. You’re able to climb in and out of your designated Predator’s orifice(s) without deterring them physically, gaining the ability to clamber all about their insides and peep themselves out partially out from their orifice to provide assistance through the usage of weapons, equipment, and items. When attempting to attack an enemy within a predator’s stomach, you roll at Standard instead of Disadvantage.
### Enhanced Ingestion-Aid
*There ya go### this’ll help you with all of those aches and pains~* As a free action, you gain the ability to use healing or buffing items on your predator for free by pouring it down/around their insides and giving them rubs inside/outside of them. If the predator is currently in the midst of digestion/damaging a target within themselves, during your turn, you can choose to use a Combat Action to knead and rub over their body to help with the digestion/damage process, increasing damage taken by +1.

### Internal Guardian
*You will not harm my gut-hut, heathen! Have at you!!* Depending upon the direction of the orifice you’re within, you can prepare a Combat Action on your turn to protect your predator from harm; using a Light weapon or a Shield, you can choose at any point of your enemy(ies) turn to pop out partially from your predator’s orifice to deflect physical attacks/block small magical attacks at Disadvantage. Attacks too big or too many to block are instead reduced in damage by 1. Once you’re partially sticking out of the orifice, you’ll become vulnerable to attacks again until your turn where you can choose to dive back into your predator or wait for them to gulp you down as you continue to stick out and perform actions/attacks within your range.

### External-Sense Training
*My prey-senses are tingling- there’s a man hiding around the corner 50 yards away in a box holding a silenced glock and a cigarette!* Your experiences and skills with sensing approaching predators or prey have allowed you to both identify what a target’s vorish preference is even if they’re not into vore or the concept, and any nearby presence that’s making itself known to the predator. This Trait also allows you to roll Internal Guardian rolls to protect your predator at Standard.

### Internal-Combat Expertise
*You’re a weakling if being in a stomach inhibits your abilities. I mean seriously### doesn’t it feel great in here?* With your careful attention and combat prowess, you’re able to add your Proficiencies and Mastery to your Light Weapons, Unarmed Strikes, Improvised Weapons, and Magic Rolls while avoiding harming your predator on accident on failed attack rolls.

### Gastro Mage Expertise
*I’m gonna cast magic in here, and NOBODY IS GONNA STOP ME!!!* When you realize that you could use your feet and other limbs to stop a predator from preventing you from casting magic, it’s become SIGNIFICANTLY easier to cast magic without being stopped with rolls made inside an enemy stomach to cast magic now being rolled as normal.

### Preyish Assistance
*Get in here- the acid’s fine!~* When a prey is attempting to escape a predator’s stomach, you can either choose to assist them or inhibit their escape; roll a Disadvantage check to see if you help them escape, hold them back, or just bump into the predator’s guts and achieve nothing. This Trait works on both enemy and ally predators while inside or outside them.

### The Healing 
*Insert semi-obscure Operation Game music here.* For whatever reason you’ve discovered you’ve gained the ability to heal your allies better at the expense of your own health; when using a Combat Action to heal an ally or use items to heal/buff an ally you heal them for +2 points of HP or buff them for 1 turn longer than normal in exchange for 2HP. When performing a check to cure someone of a disease, fix a minor disability, or even perform an actual medical operation, in exchange for 2HP per-test, the user slows down time and stops the patient from dying while converting all rolls to Advantage.

### The Ultimate Healing Touch
*I will not allow this fate to come to fruition!* You’ve learnt how to use your Healing Touch combatively against your opponents; as a Combat Action, your body goes into hyper-focus and are able to automatically dodge all non-AOE attacks for 1 turn. If you decide to use The Ultimate Healing Touch, use all but 1 point of Health to freeze time and gain +1 Combat Action for every 9 points of HP spent to use the ability; no attack can miss during this duration, and any form of regeneration cannot prevent or heal the damage caused by the attack if it’s a creature who’s born with the ability to regenerate.

### Lasso Expert
*This seemed a lot easier in the movies….* Using a Whip or a Rope with a Honda Knot, you launch it towards a prey outside or inside a predator within 15ft and pull them towards you with a Disadvantage test; if the lasso or whip grabs its intended target, make a contesting Standard test against each other, with more successes leading to the winner of the Test; equal successes means you roll the Test again, the rope-holder winning means they pull a prey into/out of a pred, and the predator winning means they gain the opportunity to swallow the rope-holder with a Disadvantage check.

### The Belly Armoury Master
*What kind of weapon do you need? I got maces, knives, daggers, shortswords, longswords, axes, battle axes, a revolver, a-* Your desire to hoard weapons for its future uses has come in very handy as you put special covers around your weapons so that they can be stuffed down into your predator with you, allowing you to pass your weapons back out to your predator in their time of need when in need of different equipment that suits the situation. You can only stuff weapons into your predator that can be fully encapsulated by their guts without sticking out of them. They cannot swallow weapons during combat.

### The Caretaker
*I will take care of you to the best of my abilities.* Your gentle aura has not only infected your allies but your enemies as well; all allies within your presence gain +1 HP from healing, roll at +1 against Tests that affect a person’s will/mind, and provide them 1 Temp. HP per turn; all enemies within your presence receive -1 HP from healing roll at -1 against Tests that affect a person’s will/mind, and deal 1 less total damage to all allies minus you with a minimum of 1.

## The Heroless (Class)
*I don't care about all your namby-pamby bullshit, I'm living through this shit my way.* Either a trained assassin, or an Otaku-turned-contract-killer, you managed to make use of some advanced technological weapon that creates an intense beam of plasma that you can attack your foes with; its design's ancient, with the unique caveat of being rechargeable through vigorous shaking, but it appears upgrades or additional weapons can be made based off of its design with enough materials, tools, and technical know-how. **Gain a Beam melee-weapon (Light/Heavy) that replaces Durability with Charge, and having a Charge of 6. Recharging requires 1 Action to perform, and restores 6 Charges to your weapon. This Weapon cannot kill normally, and cannot reduce their HP further than 1 unless a Finisher is performed; enemies reduced to 1 this way temporarily lose their healing regeneration effects.**

**Actions performable while wielding this kind of weapon is listed like so:**
- **Strike: Standard Attack, applies benefits from Traits that enhance basic Melee attacks. Consumes 1 Charge with each Strike.**
- **Heavy Strike: An Attack that breaks the Guard of Guarding enemies if struck; costs 1 Action and deals +1 Damage, but can't be taken before or after a Strike due to the strength of the attack. Can be held instead of released to perform Charged Strike. Consumes 1 Charge with each strike.**
- **Charged Strike: Only usable after holding a Heavy Strike; costs 1 Action. Holding a Heavy Strike with its trigger pressed down, energy from the battery charges the plasma for a greater strike, converting its single-target attack into a cone-ranged slash (Based on the weapon's Reach) that bypasses any Guarding enemy's Guard (But not barriers) and dealing Heavy Strike's +1 Damage plus +1 Damage per point of Charge consumed to charge the attack up to a Maximum of +3 Damage/3 points of Charge. Movement while charging a Charged Strike is reduced down to a 5ft Move, and Dodge Actions can be taken while charging. Consumes 1 Charge + 1 Charge per Action used Charging with each strike.**
- **Fast Haymaker: A quick and sudden punch meant for interrupting weak, costing 1 Action and benefitting from Unarmed Strike attacks, this attack normally deals just 1 Damage. Succesfully landing a Fast Haymaker on a Target removes 1 Action from the target of the Haymaker's Action Economy (enemies can only be reduced down to 1 Action). Certain stronger enemies can be immune to this attack and Powerful enemies are fully immune to its effects.**
- **Strong Haymaker: A slow, powerfully heavy strike costing 2 Actions and benefitting from unarmed Strike attacks, this attack normally deals just 2 Damage or 1 Damage if choosing to attack in a 5ft cone, and can bypass Guarding enemies. Successfully landing a Strong Haymaker on a Target, the user makes a Standard Test, with success Stunning the Target for 1 of their turns; if the Target has less than 50% of their HP remaining, the user may immediately leap towards/around their opponent and perform a Standard Test, with success allowing the user to perform a Wrestling Move upon their opponent, dealing 2 Damage and forcing the Target Prone. Stronger enemies are only Stunned after 2-3 Strong Haymakers, with Powerful enemies only Stunned after 5 Strong Haymakers but might be vulnerable to fewer or single Strong Haymakers during certain attacks.** 
- **Dark Step: Like Dodge but consumed after proper usage, costs 1 Action; the user waits for their Target to make a successful attack against them before attempting to evade the attack with a Standard Test, with success moving them 5ft away in any available direction without triggering an Attack of Opportunity and allowing them to then make a Strike against their attacker or a Strong Haymaker for free. Consumes 1 Charge with each strike.**
- **Guard: Using your weapon, you guard against any attack thrown at you from in front of you, consuming 1 Charge with each Strike/Projectile you guard against, but can still guard yourself from damage even without power; can't protect you against powerful attacks like Heavy Strike or Strong Haymaker.**
- **Finisher: Only performable when the Enemy is 1HP, but is a Free Action; the Heroless performs a powerfully dynamic slash that seems to almost slow down time and blur their body before fully striking their enemy down using a Standard Test with successes on 4, 5, and 6. This is the Heroless' main way of killing their enemies.**
- **Wrestling Move - Only performable against Stunned targets, and if their HP is brought down to 1, it automatically transitions into a Finisher; the user performs a Standard Test on a Target within their Reach to deal damage to them before throwing them Prone to the floor.**

**After landing a killing blow on an enemy, the Heroless enters a Dark Trance, rolls 3d6 and look at the roll; if you manage to roll 3 of a Kind, you enter into a Trance for 3 Rounds and have one of the benefits down below; if a 3 of a Kind isn't rolled, nothing happens and on the next Dark Trance, after rolling the dice any dice may be adjusted by 1 number going upwards, looping back around after 6; this bonus continues to increase by +1 until a Dark Trance is rolled and a Jackpot is performed.**
- **1) Jackpot - The Heroless' next kill causes the enemy to explode into a plume of blood and coins, earning the Heroless 2d6 worth of Silver Pieces after killing them.**
- **2) Strawberry on the Shortcake - The Heroless' hair goes golden, their Movement doubles in total, and every time the user lands a successful Strike on an enemy, their next Finisher strikes everyone down in a 5ft cone, regardless of Health. Only does 1.5x damage to Powerful enemies.**
- **3) Blueberry Cheese Brownie - The Heroless moves at 10ft per Movement Action whilst raising their weapon into the air; their Strikes become Ranged Attacks that fire explosive beams that slash all in a 5ft Diamond of the target hit whilst dealing 2x Damage.**
- **4) Cranberry Chocolate Sundae - The Heroless' world and hair goes white and black as they Move at 15ft per Movement Action but can leap up to singular enemies with a 5-10ft leap before instantly killing them in a brutal bloody fashion; rather than lasting 3 Rounds, this Dark Trance allows you to target any number of target equal to the number of Rounds available while in a Dark Trance.**
- **5) Anarchy in the Galaxy - Like rolling 7s at a Jackpot machine, this is a very powerful Dark Trance to get as it can reward the user with riches or massive killing potential in a pink energy rain-shower; over the course of a Quest, every Anarchy in the Galaxy rolled during a Dark Trance gives you 1 stack of said Trance, with each stack giving you 1d6 worth of Gold at the end of a Quest; you can choose to spend all stacks of A.i.t.G. while in combat to deal 7 Damage per-Stack gained in a 25ft Radius. This attack can't be Dodged or Blocked.**

## Soul Cleansers (Class)
*The delicate balance of souls must be maintained, 'less everything fall into disarray and our world collapses in upon itself.* There are 3 different kinds of Soul Cleansers in the world, all of which are born differently to one and another, but aside from their initial differences they've managed to collectively work together to prevent life-threatening events from destroying the world over and over- despite their disdain with each other from centuries of hatred.
### Reapers (Class Theme)
*Through years of traditions and research, life is equally renewed as it is taken away, and one must be able to handle these burdens less they lose themselves in the seas of life and drown.* Being born in the Society of Souls, you eventually join the guardsmen known as the Gotei 13 to become a protector of the people, eventually becoming powerful enough to gain your own Zanpakuto as you subdue an Asauchi that turns into your new blade and you begin to understand more about your blade and soul. ***Gain a Katana called a Zanpakuto that allows you to cleanse Hollows of their Corruption and purify Lost Spirits for entry into the Society of Souls. At 150 EXP, the Reaper must roll a Disadvantage Test with success only on 6s every in-game hour in order to hear the whispers of your soul inside your Zanpakuto, with 3 successful attempts guaranteeing the connection between Reaper and their Soul who tells them part of their name, unlocking its Shikai form; at 1000 EXP, the Reaper may gain access to their Bankai- but only if they're able to subdue it within their own soul through battle or special manifestation techniques made by the Reapers; at 10000 EXP, its possible for a Reaper with such power and experience to unlock their True Shikai and Bankai by Training, learning their other names (if they have more than one), and/or learning to become one with and accepted by their Soul.***
### Arrancars (Class Theme)

- **Hollow (Sub-Class Theme):** *Dying twice and being reborn anew, a Hollow remembers next to nought of their previous life other than strong memories of those closest to them. More often than not, this turns them into their main prey as a result.* The weakest of the Hollows, devouring enough Souls/Hollows to gain enough Soul EXP allows them to evolve to higher statuses; at 100 S.EXP, they evolve into an Advanced Hollow capable of sapient thought and speech with additional powerful features; at 500 S.EXP, along with power they evolve into a new form of Hollow called a Menos- specifically the Adjuchas classification, and gain an even more advanced perception of themselves, the world around them, and an even more unique form with with features similar to animals with a monstrous, bone-covered features; at 1250 S.EXP, they evolve into the very powerful Vasto Lorde which attain more human-like appearances but vary in size and physicality. With aid, at Adjuchas or Vasto Lorde Hollows can have their mask ripped off/apart to transform them into an Arrancar, with Vasto Lorde Hollows having a greater source of unique and powerful abilities to their repertoire.
	- **Arrancar (Sub-Class Theme):** *A higher-class of Hollow, evolving from Adjuchas after having their mask be torn from their face using special items- specifically The Hogyoku, they take on humanoid forms with leftover pieces of their mask residing upon their face; they retain traits of Hollows such as having a hole within a part of their body that pierces the hole way through their limb/body/head, but unlike other Hollows they regain internal organs similar to a human, but it's unknown as to what their biology looks like.* Arrancars are usually made through evolving an Adjuchas through The Hogyoku, but through specific scientific processes, artificial Arrancars can be made by forcing a Hollow to endure life-threatening experiments to the point of evolution or death. ***Players may start as an Arrancar born artificially for the sake of a campaign, but depending upon the setting they may start with 0 EXP or a set amount of EXP.***
	- **Vastocar (Sub-Class Theme):** *A rare sight to behold, their power is almost as befuddling as their personalities, but make no mistake, underneath the sea of souls they inhabit within themselves, their power is grand and not to be underestimated.* A stronger, even more-powerful form of an Arrancar, born from the evolution of a Powerful Hollow or a Vasto Lorde-class Hollow, Vastocars gain access to the abilities of an Arrancar and more due to their larger pool of power that far-outclass regular Arrancars as a result. ***Power Must be gained through Evolution of a Vasto Lorde-class Hollow; evolved similarly to an Arrancar.***
Once a Hollow evolves into an Arrancar, the following abilities are gained:

### Quincies (Class Theme)
*A bi-product of an old king's thirst for revenge an old power that created everything, a Quincy are regular humans capable of using similar abilities to Reapers and Arrancars but are able to siphon the very essence that makes up their worlds and turn it into their power and ammunition to defeat their foes and obliterate their soul from existence.*

### Smithing (Class Passive)
When Crafting a new Weapon, a Weapon Mold is needed as a base for the design; a clay-like material used to keep the shape of whatever's poured into it that can then be recollected afterwards as a blueprint to create the same weapon later for profit. Summon Knights only need the

### Weapon Mastery (Class Passive)


### Summon Knight Fighting-Style (Class Passive)
*As a Summon Knight, they craft their own weapons and can only gain Mastery with Weapons they've made on their own with their Summon Monster. With that in mind, they've been trained to fight with certain techniques in mind to fully-utilize any weapon they've made to the fullest, allowing them the best control over their tools and the battlefield.* Each Summon Knight fighting-style is listed below as to what each weapon-type can do in combat. ***All Summon Knights start out with 1 unbreakable low-damage Blacksmith Hammer, 1 Weapon Mold of their choosing from the above-listed options, and Iron Ore.***

# Unchained

## Sofficer (Class)
*I will uphold the law with my body and soul!...Mostly my body.* Due to your physical physique and unique practical training, you’ve learnt a unique form of hand-to-hand combat that focuses upon quickly subduing and restricting a target’s movements and actions while avoiding and disabling surrounding assailants with complex manoeuvres. You gain Proficiency with Unarmed strikes, and when performing grapple checks on a target, you deal +1 extra damage while restraining the target and automatically perform the Evade Combat Action for free while you’re grappling a target and are being attacked by them or other enemies.
### CQC Manipulator (Class Trait)
How d’ya like that feint? If you miss an attack on your opponent, you can choose to allow them to attempt to attack back with no negative modifiers; if the attack would land, immediately make a Disadvantage roll to Evade the hit, and if the attack misses by successful Evasion or bad rolls, you make an immediate Disadvantage roll to counter-hit without counter. If the counter-hit is successful, the target is stunned for 1 turn but if they can’t be stunned, they take +1 damage for 1 turn. (Prereq: Sofficer, Opportunist Trait)
### Martial Arts Training (Class Trait)
Don’t think I’m just some ordinary Tavern-brawler. You’ve been trained in Martial Arts, gaining +1 damage in your Unarmed damage, your Unarmed Attack tests are rolled at Advantage, and are given the ability to counter-attack upon enemies within Close Range who’ve missed an attack. (Prereq: Sofficer, Martial Artist, Opportunist Trait)
### Scissor-lock (Class Trait)
Struggle any further and my thighs are gonna snap your collar bone! As a Combat Action, you can lunge forwards 5ft in any direction before attempting to lock your legs around your target in a grapple Test and force them into the Prone state, yourself also entering a Prone state as you hold them down; the same turn you manage to land this grapple upon your target, immediately perform a Test for free to deal 2 damage to the target. Once the target has been knocked out from the grapple, you immediately escape from the Prone position and are standing again, but you can end the grapple whenever to return to a Standing position during your turn. For every size category at Large or above, increase the grapple range and number of grapplable targets of this trait by +1; at Very Large it becomes a range of 1x2; at Giant it becomes 1x3, and etc. (Prereq: Sofficer, Strong)
### Disarm and Conquer (Class Trait)
Edged weapons are dangerous! Slaps hand with knife in it. You could seriously hurt somebody! You attempt to disarm every enemy within your melee range with an Attack Action; the test is rolled with your proficiency in weapons or unarmed combat except for Heavy weapons which are automatically rolled at Standard even if you have mastery of a weapon, or Disadvantage if you have no or only proficiency in Heavy weapons. All targets fail automatically if they haven’t used the Evade command whereas successful Evades cause the user to maintain a hold of their weapon. All targets who have their weapons knocked away have them flung 15ft away from themselves, then you take the opportunity in the confusion to attack everyone at once, dealing 2 damage; those who used the Evade action during their turn can only avoid this second attack if their first attempt to Evade was successful. (Prereq: Sofficer, Opportunist Trait, Cleave)
### Authoritative Aura (Class)
Everybody SHUT UP! I have an erec### When raising your voice to speak to a large crowd of people, no matter the situation, you gain an Advantage to controlling/manipulating the crowds, and if any form of law enforcements are under your command or if someone higher-up agrees/goes along with your suggestion, they’ll follow your orders to best extent of their abilities. When in combat, you can use this Trait to give every ally +1 Temp. HP up to a Maximum of 2. This Temp. HP will dissipate at the end of combat. (Prereq: Sofficer, Charismatic, )
### Riot Form (Class)
Stop the crowds movements and push them back### EVERYONE!! Using a Tower Shield in-hand, you raise your defenses and make Advantage Tests against any projectiles your shield is capable of deflecting and negate the damage on successful rolls. Whenever an opponent attempts to shove or reposition you, you make a Standard Test to negate the Reposition/Shove, and for every failed attempt to Attack, Reposition, or Shove, perform a counter-Attack upon the target with a Standard Test.
### Wrestling Style: Taunt and Dominate (Class)
How does it feel to be thrown around by a superior fighter? Humiliating, ain’t it? You can choose either to use this as an Offensive or Defensive Trait; if you use this Trait to attack your opponent, make a Grapple check against your opponent, if you miss, your grapple misses entirely but if it lands you knock the target over into the Prone state before slamming them into the floor for 3 damage. If they’re still alive, roll Standard to Taunt the target, but if they’re dead/unconscious, roll Advantage to Taunt all enemies within ear-shot. Taunted enemies must make a Disadvantage Test at the start of their turns to overcome the effects of Taunting, otherwise they lose 1 Combat Action during their turns, and can only Move or Attack during them.
### Protector’s Restraint (Class)
Oi, you! You’ve violated the law! Do you have a license for that? Prepare this Trait as an Action; if you’re standing by an ally within 5ft of you and they’re attacked by an enemy, you can make a Disadvantage Test to deflect the Attack, a 2nd Disadvantage Test to disarm them, then a 3rd test at Standard to grapple the Target; if you fail any rolls in the sequence, the assault ends.
### Heavy Grappling Training (Class)
Bigger criminals are just as easy to restrain. You’re able to grapple targets from Medium up to Very Large Size at Advantage.
### Light Grappling Training (Class)
Hahah### gotcha ya tiny fuck! You’re able to grapple targets from Medium to Very Small at Standard.
### Commanding Sofficer Status (Class)
We need to do this! That’s an order!! Due to your high skill and lengthy experience, you exude an aura of courageous or commanding status that enables your allies to roll any mind-affecting Tests with Advantage. Also during your turn, you can command all of your allies to perform 1 Action each for free, but it’s up to them to determine what you mean by your command. (Prereq:Sofficer, all Sofficer Traits, Strong, Charismatic, Perceptive, Insightful )
