## Pred Traits

### Hungry Jaws
*So hungry...so incredibly hungry...you'll have to do.* You're so hungry you don't even try to grapple the prey and immediately make a Devour Test.
### Strong-tail
*You think my tail looks silly? Why don't you come closer and say it to my face!* you can grapple enemies within 10ft with your tail and bring them closer to you.
### Tail-storage
There...you'll fit nicely in there while I get on with my life. After successfully eating prey, you may make another test to move your prey into your tail, requiring them to make two tests in order to free themselves from your guts. When a prey is contained within the tail, your movement speed is not impacted. ***If your race does not naturally have a tail, you suddenly grow a large, thick/fat tail. You also gain an extra stomach.***
### Taur-tum
Sorry sir but I don't give piggy back rides, but I do have an alternative. As a taur you have a second stomach, and can move your prey into your quadruped half to allow yourself to be unrestrained from movement penalties. ***If your race is not normally a taur, they either permanently transform into one or gain the ability to switch back and forth between a taur-form and an anthro form. You also gain an extra stomach, and increase your movement by 5 feet.***
### Naga/Lamia-tum
*It's not my fault you keep on tripping over me, you just don't look at where you're going.* As a Naga/Lamia you have a long second stomach, and can move your prey into your snake-like half to be unrestrained from movement penalties. ***If your race is not normally a Naga/Lamia, they either permanently transform into one, or gain the ability to switch back and forth between a Naga/Lamia-form and an anthro form. You also gain an extra stomach, and the ability to use both hands after grappling a target with your tail instead of your hands but must be specified.***
### Strong-acids

*Don't worry guys, this snack won't take me long.... Mmmm~ I feel refreshed already!* Your metabolism is so fast, you heal instantly from digesting beaten prey.
### Healing-juices
*Stop screaming- I'm trying to help you, I just need you in my mouth!* Your insides have the ability to secrete a healing juice, allowing your teammates to heal themselves without needing to Test but requiring to be encased fully inside of yourself. ***Requires Healer Trait.***

*You and my ally shall not share the same fate- for it is you and you alone who'll be digested!* Using an Action, you can control the internal effects of your belly to where you can manually discern who inside of you is being held safely, and who you desire to take Damage within you.
### Natural Focused Stomach Control

### Bait & eat
*That's right- you know you wanna grab them and save them, just come and get closer and reach on in~* Whenever a creature attempts to free a Prey who's currently stuck in your orifice/in the Devour State, make a free Disadvantage Test to put the 2nd creature into the Devour State, with your next Swallow swallowing both at once.
### Grown-Hunger
*I know my kind tend to be smaller, but my appetite requires a much larger form~* Your hunger is so powerful your body and stomach has grown in size; increase your character's size by +1, then increase their Capacity by +1. ***This can be taken beside Titan-Stomach.***

*Don't worry, I know it doesn't look like it, but I can fit more!* You gain an Extra Stomach, however it is 1 size smaller than your max-sized stomach.
### Strong Stance
*Is carrying this much a hindrance? Nonsense! I can still haul a couple hundred more pounds!* You can remain mobile even while after consuming a prey +1 size-category larger than yourself/enough prey that exceed your total limit.

How does it feel to have every fiber of my body stopping your futile attempts at escaping~?* Due to your more in-depth and experienced muscle-control over your gastric system and other organs, you make your Prey's Tests to escape at an addtional -1 Test Category; if their Tests were to go below a Disadvantage Test with only success on 6s, their Test automatically fails. (Pre-Req: The Anti-Struggler Hold)

### Gastro-Mage
*I swear man, I saw another person inside that guy and they fired a fireball at me!* You can cast spells inside your predator's guts, using them from the safety from the rest of the world. Attempting to cast spells within an enemy's stomach will give them the opportunity to stop you with a test, with bigger prey having a disadvantage against Tests to stop them. The Predator, however, must have an unused Action Point from when they ended their last turn in order to counter any spellcasting within them.
### Magic Hands* 
*Don't watch the mouth, watch the hands~* You're magical touch allows you to heal a target by rubbing and/or massaging them for +1 HP alongside the Healer Trait. *Requires Healer Trait.

I had a huge lunch and that little critter-- how can I still be hungry!?* When inside someone, you can do a 2d6/Standard test to leech life off them and heal by 1 while the target takes 1 damage. The Predator can take a Standard Test if they're 1 size category smaller or larger than themselves, but must take a Disadvantage Test if they're 2 or more size categories smaller or larger than themselves. This Trait cannot cause the Parasite to kill their Host while in/on them.
### Symbiote
*Don't we feel much better?* *Yes...we do....* You have the ability to merge yourself with your predator with 3 options:

- Add your Current and Max HP to the Pred

- Give a Trait to your pred that can also come from any Monster/Creature Traits that aren't normally accessible to players.

- Temporarily reduce your predator's Max HP by 25% rounded down to closest whole, but give them 1 addtional Action Point per-turn.

After every 2nd round after merging with your predator, you must make a Standard Test or be forcibly expelled from the Pred, reversing the effect you chose to give the Predator. If any damage was taken while you were both combined, damage is split amongst you both evenly until either you're both left at 1HP or both taken to 0, causing you both to immediately uncombine from each other and fall unconscious; this applies to healing too.

While outside of combat, you only make a Test every waking hour, and every 8 hours during periods of sleep or while under the Sleep Condition.
