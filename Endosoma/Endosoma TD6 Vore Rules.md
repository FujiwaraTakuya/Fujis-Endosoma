# Vore Rules

## Conditions
When attempting to 'Vore' someone, the following conditions must be met:
1) Your target is within 5ft of you.
2) The target must be grappled before you can attempt swallowing your prey.
3) You must both make opposing Tests to see if the prey is swallowed, or if the prey gets a 2nd Test to see if they can escape your grasp in that moment.

### Grappling the target (Grapple Test)

Once you're within range of your target prey, you must grapple them; rolling a Test for Ability using 1 Action, make it known that you're intending to grab the target to the DM before he accesses the situation for the roll. Prey who're equal-sized to you as a predator means you both roll with a Standard Test; prey who're smaller than the predator must roll with disadvantage while the predator rolls with advantage, and vice-versa with predators who're smaller than their prey. This ruling still applies even with just the intention to grapple and perform a different action.

### Eating/Feeding the target to another target (Devour/Feeding Test)

When the target or a target has been grappled, you can spend a 2nd action on your turn if you haven't already used it yet to attempt to devour your target with another test using the prior test as reference with size differences. If the Prey fails their roll, the prey is consumed, but if the prey succeeds, they may attempt to escape the grapple during the predator's turn. While a predator is holding onto an unwilling prey, the predator loses 10ft of speed to their movement until they're either unconscious, digested, or willing. If another character has grappled onto a target and happens to be within 5ft of their predatory ally, they can use their Action to feed their friend the person they have in hand, requiring a test to see if it succeeds or not.

If the target prey is an ally, if they're willing to be eaten, no roll is needed to grab and consume them whole.

### Inside the stomach/chamber

When a prey starts their turn within a stomach, they can choose one of the following:
*) Escape - Attempt a Disadvantage Test to escape the/a chamber within the predator; if there are multiple chambers, with each success the prey can continue escaping until they're either out of the predator, or fail a test.
*) Rub Insides - Ultimately does nothing other than comfort the predator and let them know you're enjoying the environment.
*) Test for Ability - Magic Casters can still use magic on themselves, the predator's insides, or the the area around them, but blindly shooting magic around the predator without a sense of direction requires the caster to roll a 1d8 to determine which direction it should be aimed towards. Melee and projectiles can't be used while in here aside from items.
*) Wait - Essentially do nothing because they can't think of anything to do so either await their fate, or hope for their ally to save them.

If the prey is still within a predator's stomach, the predator can choose whether or not they digest their prey and make them take damage, or start digesting them outright once their HP raches 0; players within a stomach, when their HP reaches 0, only become unconscious and aren't able to be digested until combat ends and all players are completely defeated, but NPCs can either be chosen to be digested immediately or be held within a predator's stomach(s), with some gaining special properties that won't allow them to be digested, stopping players from digesting them unless they force it upon their target, or even having an immunity to digestion.

Prey who have been defeated and are being digested heal the predator in 2 turns, unless they have the Fast-Metaoblism Trait which would heal them instantly.

### Capacities

All preds of specific size have a capacity that allows them to consume a certain amount. Use the Handbook for TD6 Vore Rules as an explanation on pred capacities for prey.
