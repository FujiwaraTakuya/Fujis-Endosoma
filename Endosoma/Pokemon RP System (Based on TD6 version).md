# Pokemon Creation
Use the [Tiny Dungeons Template (Based on TD6 version)](Tiny%20Dungeons%20Template%20(Based%20on%20TD6%20version).md#) as a base for creating Character Sheets for Trainers and Pokemon.
## Creating Trainer's Sheet

[Endosoma Size and Weight Character Stuff](Endosoma%20Size%20and%20Weight%20Character%20Stuff.md#)

Heavy Weapons are held in 2 hands, have a 10ft Reach instead of 5, using an item with one of their hands disables their ability to attack that Round. Deals 2 Damage.

Ranged Weapons are held with 2 hands, shoot a single projectile up to 30ft, and requires an Action to Load the Weapon and an Action to Fire the Weapon. Deals 1 Damage.

# Combat Actions
## Move Cooldowns
During Combat, certain Moves will be limited with how often you can use them in-Combat by putting them on Cooldown. The more Powerful a Move is, the longer it takes for it to come off Cooldown. This is represented with the following chart (Base Power, without S.T.A.B.):
- 1-2 Damage - No Cooldown
- 3-4 Damage - 1 Round Cooldown
- 5-6 Damage - 2 Round Cooldown
- 7-8 Damage - 3 Round Cooldown
- 9-10 Damage - 4 Round Cooldown
- 11-12 Damage - 5 Round Cooldown
- 13-14 Damage - 6 Round Cooldown
## Critical hits
Moves that perform a Critical Hit deal extra Damage if a Move rolls a 6 during its Test to hit, with each 6 rolled increasing the Damage the Move deals by the Base Power + S.T.A.B. (E.g. If a Grass Pokemon hits a Rock Pokemon with a Grass Move for 4 Damage, the attack deals 12 Damage (+4 for Weakness, +4 for half of 8 for S.T.A.B.) normally, but as a Crit it deals 24 Damage).

Normally, it's impossible for a Move to randomly perform a Critical Hit, but certain Moves have the ability to Crit unlike the majority of Moves, and certain Move Effects or Item Effects can help increase the user's Crit Rate by increasing the number of sides on the Die. are needed to succeed the roll (E.g. Focus Energy normally makes all Moves able to Crit, but Moves that already Crit go from being able to Crit on only 6s to being able to crit from 5-6.)

# Out of Combat Tips
If you have a hard time trying to figure out what to do in an open world game like this, here's a list of recommendations I can give you as a future DM and TTRPG Player to explore the world and interact with the world.
- Ask about what you can do
- Ask where you are/what you see
- Ask about rumours or look for quests at each Main Cities' Quest Boards
- Ask if you can make something (Item; Enchantment; Spell; Building; Friendships/Partnerships)
- Ask if you can do something (Illegal or Legal (Usually comes with warnings, but not always))
- Ask for information about the world/country/building/people/race/creature/history/
  achievements/laws/powers/magic/engineering/size of thing/etc.
- Perform an Action not given a visible mechanic through Booklet explanations (DM advisory)
- Ask to explore around randomly in a direction
- Search a general area for something specific or anything of interest
- Ask if you can See/Hear/Smell/Feel/Taste anything of interest that you're sense
- Ask for something specific (E.g. "I wanna find an Equipment Shop for Weapons", "Is there a Potions Shop in this city?", "Where could we sell this tamed beast we caught?", "Can I study this person's schedule to trap them?", "How do I learn Potion Making/Armor Smithing/Weapon Crafting?")
- Ask DM for ideas and recommendations
- Experiment with stuff!
