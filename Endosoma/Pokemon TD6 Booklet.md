#Pokemon #TinyDungeons6 
This is a booklet explaining on how to play as a Pokemon or Pokemon Trainer in the TTRPG system Tiny Dungeons 2; related pages: [Pokemon TD6 Moves](Pokemon%20TD6%20Moves.md#), [Endosoma TD6 Links](Endosoma%20TD6%20Links.md#)

# 
# Trainer Creation
If you're planning on playing as JUST a Trainer, you create your Character like normal through the Tiny Dungeons system, but you also gain access to Trainer-only Traits, can add a Starter Pokemon from the list available below (or wait until they find their first Catch of choice through wild encounters) to their Character Sheet in their Inventory-Section as (-Pokeball name-:-Pokemon Name-) before giving the Pokemon themselves a Character Sheet.
## 1a: Create your Trainer
Whilst ignoring the Traits you gain for Character Creation (for now), use the [Endosoma Simplified Gameplay Guidebook](Endosoma%20Simplified%20Gameplay%20Guidebook.md#) or [Endosoma Detailed Gameplay Guidebook](Endosoma%20Detailed%20Gameplay%20Guidebook.md#) to create your Character.
## 1b: Add Trainer Traits (Optional)
Using the TD6 handbook on available Traits, [Pokemon TD6 Trait List](Pokemon%20TD6%20Trait%20List.md#), and any other list of Traits, add any available Traits to your Character Sheet.
## 1c: Learn Pokemon Moves (Optional)
Unlike normal Pokemon, certain beings are capable of learning Pokemon Moves despite not being Pokemon; instead of 10 EXP to learn a Move, it becomes 100 EXP and requires to be taught by another non-Pokemon Teacher who knows the Move, or a Anthro/Furryfied Pokemon Teacher that can communicate with the Trainer to teach them the ability and usage of the Move.
### Trainer Features
Here is an extensive list of benefits and drawbacks a Trainer has while their Pokemon is out in combat.
- While a Trainer has a Pokemon actively out in the world, all damage the Trainer deals to other creatures aside from Pokemon is reduced by 75% down to a minimum of 1.
- When a Trainer would take damage from an AOE attack, depending upon the direction it would be coming from, if a allied unit/Pokemon is in front of/above the Trainer, they reduce the damage taken by the attack by 50% down to a minimum of 1 damage/reduce the chances of a status affliction being taken by 1 Category. This does not reduce the damage taken if a Pokemon/unit is knocked back into the Trainer and pushes all units back into the same/nearby tiles.
- Trainers can choose to either move separately from their Pokemon or move alongside them; if they Move alongside them, they both share the same Initiative but don't act at the same time, whilst Pokemon moving separately will have their own Initiative rolls for combat; this function will be better explained below.
- While in Combat, if a Trainer believes their pokemon needs a new held item to help deal with battle encounters, a Trainer can spend an Action pulling out and swapping/throwing an Item to their Pokemon to hold; if the Pokemon already has a Held Item upon them, the Pokemon has to have an Action available to them in order to perform the switch, meaning if the switch happens before the Pokemon's turn they lose out on an Action afterwards, and this item-switch must be done within 15ft of the Trainer. If an Enemy Pokemon has a CR Action queued up, they can opt to spend it to deflect the item away/destroy it with a Move; if the Test made has at least 2 6s, the item is destroyed, otherwise is deflected in an area within a d8 space around the Trainer.
- Trainers can ride Pokemon equal or larger-sized than themselves, or can be dragged by Pokemon equal or 1 size category smaller than themselves; riding a Pokemon of equal size reduces its Movement by 5ft whilst being dragged about by a smaller creature reduces its Movement by 10ft. Mythical and Legendary Pokemon bypass these rules unless wounded below 30% of their Max HP, but still require to be equal or larger sized to be ridden upon or equal or smaller to be dragged about.
- Even if the Trainer's defeated, the Pokemon can act autonomously from their Trainer, but they can't take the Trainer's Pokeballs to call upon more allies or catch Pokemon.
- A Trainer's Pokemon can converse with other Pokemon with regular conversations to convince them with information, negate combat encounters with diplomacy, encourage/incite Actions to be taken against a group, and much, much more normally quite difficultly achieved between non-Pokemon and Pokemon.
- Furryfied and Anthropomorphic Pokemon cannot be caught by other Trainers with Pokeballs due to their slightly differing DNA; they can only be caught through consent and trust, being born and registered as the Trainer's pokemon, or temporarily befriended using Pokemon Ranger Gear.
- Any Trainer-commanded attacks aimed at an Ally or an area with an ally, intentional or unintentional, reduce the attack's Test by -1 Category.
- Outside of Tournaments and Gym Challenges, Players can have more than 1-2 Pokemon out on the field to aid in combat, up to a Limit of 6 out at once.
- Pokemon in a Trainer's Party can be switched out using their PokeDex as long as they have an Internet Connection. Pokemon can always be switched at a PC in a PokeCenter as long as it has power.
#### Trainer Function: Team Mode & Command Mode
##### Team Mode
When a Trainer calls out or has an allied Pokemon to their side and chooses to have them in Team Mode, the Pokemon can share its space and sharing its initiative with its Trainer whilst maintaining their separate Actions. While a Pokemon is in Team Mode, the any Movement Action the Trainer takes must also be taken by their Pokemon and consuming an Action available from each or else they must transition to Command Mod.
While a Pokemon and their Trainer are in Team Mode, a Trainer shares their Action Economy with their Pokemon, but not vice versa; this allows a Pokemon to gain an additional 1-2 Actions performable during their turn, in exchange for both Pokemon and Trainer taking damage from attacks directed towards either of them. If a Pokemon  wishes to attack more than 2 times in a Round, they must succeed a Disadvantage Test or else the attack doesn't come out due to fatigue and the Action is consumed.
When a Trainer uses a Move action with their Pokemon by them in Team Mode, they move with the Pokemon's Movement speed instead of the Trainers to remain beside each other, or else they must transition to Command Mode; this means a Pokemon can help a Trainer move using their ability to fly, swim, or teleport.
##### Command Mode
When a Trainer calls out or has an allied Pokemon on the field and chooses to have them in Command Mode, the Pokemon remains in its own separate space and initiative to its Trainer, can act independantly from its Trainer, and can setup/perform Actions that can benefit their Trainer/allies more easily such as odd-angle Pokeball throws or grabbing and throwing Trainers up to high-up perches.
While a Pokemon is in Command Mode, it acts like its own separate unit on the field with its own Action Economy; during the Trainer's Turn, they are able to use 1 Action to command their Pokemon during their Turn to perform an Attack or Action without consuming one of their Actions before or after their Turn arrives/happens.
If a Pokemon owned by a Trainer has an Action remaining that isn't used as a CR Action, Trainers may perform unique manoeuvres (as allowed by DMs) to perform actions normally not performable alone such as throwing a Pokeball at your own Pokemon to have them launch the ball further or at a strange angle at another Pokemon to capture them if they're protecting themselves defensively from such attacks. These unique manoeuvres can be almost anything able to be performed between a Trainer and their Pokemon as long as it's admissible by the DM of your game.
# Pokemon Creation
Creating a Pokemon is like creating a Standard Character for a Tiny Dungeons game, but they gain access to Pokemon-only Traits during the creation process, through Heritage Traits they can either be classified as Feral, Anthropomorphic, or Furryfied, and depending upon which Heritage Trait they choose, they may have access to additional capabilities and effects only attainable to each Heritage Trait they choose.

Pokemon differ greatly to other creatures in the world of Tiny Dungeons/Endosoma; Pokemon have type-strengths and weaknesses affected by their Biology as Pokemon, and because of these weaknesses their environment or elemental attacks/magic can severely injure them worse than other creatures, or barely inhibit them at all, meaning common magic or natural environments can physically injure or inhibit Pokemon just like other Pokemon Moves normally will. However, due to the unique semi-stable nature of their effects and abilities on creatures outside of their realm, non-Pokemon creatures take half damage from all Pokemon Moves aside from non-scaling Status Effects.

It's recommended that any creature of Large size to be kept in their Pokeball while traversing public streets in towns and villages, but Huge or larger creatures are mandatorily mandated to stay inside their Pokeballs unless it's for their job or for the sake of a battle.

In this game, Pokemon are born either Feral, Anthro, or Furryfied, but this Heritage Trait can be changed later on through a Ball-Transfer Machine and specially-designed Pokeballs which allow for visual/permanent transformations into other Heritage Traits.
## 2a: Create your Pokemon
Whilst ignoring the Traits and Heritage Traits you gain for Character Creation (for now), use the [Endosoma Simplified Gameplay Guidebook](Endosoma%20Simplified%20Gameplay%20Guidebook.md#) or [Endosoma Detailed Gameplay Guidebook](Endosoma%20Detailed%20Gameplay%20Guidebook.md#) to create your Character.
## 2b: Choose a Pokemon Heritage Trait
As a base, all Pokemon start with one of the 3 Heritage Traits mentioned below: Feral, Anthropomorphic, and Furryfied; this Heritage Trait isn't named in the Heritage section. They also gain access to 1 additional non-Pokemon Trait if they're physically applicable for it, and this is the Trait that is named in their Heritage section.
## 2c: Pokemon Strengths and Weaknesses
At the bottom of the Heritage Trait, you list your Pokemon's Strength's and Weaknesses to damage-types, like so:
	Strengths: Fighting and Grass (x0.25), Poison, Bug, and Fairy (x0.5)
	Weaknesses: Flying, Rock, Fire, and Psychic (x2)
If a Pokemon is currently a Shadow Pokemon, above the normal Typings for the Pokemon, the following should be listed:
	 Currently a Shadow Pokemon!
	 Strengths: All Types
	 Weaknesses: None
	 Shadow Points: 
	 Read [Pokemon TD6 Booklet](Pokemon%20TD6%20Booklet.md#) for more about Shadow Pokemon
## 2d: Add Pokemon Traits (Optional)
Using the TD6 handbook on available Traits, [Pokemon TD6 Trait List](Pokemon%20TD6%20Trait%20List.md#), and any other list of Traits, add any available Traits to your Character Sheet.
## 2e: Give your Pokemon its Moves
All Pokemon gain access to their Level 1 Moves for free without issue, but any Moves gained afterwards must be gained through EXP expenditure; Moves must be gained in order of Level progression, but that aside, gaining a new Move is like gaining a new Trait in that 10 EXP must be spent to learn a new Move.

Moves learned through TMs require 2 successful Tests on a Standard Test when learning them to learn them permanently.

### Pokemon Features
Here is an extensive list of benefits and drawbacks a Pokemon has while out in combat.
- Pokemon have 3 Heritages they can be born into: Feral, Anthropomorphic, and Furryfied, explained as such:
	- **Feral -** _You teach me and I'll teach you! POKEMOOOON!!_ As a natural Pokemon, you don't understand how to use regular tools or weaponry, but as long as an object's simple enough for them to wield, they can still use it as a weapon. **Feral Pokemon cannot use regular weaponry outside of Improvised and Unarmed Strike Attacks, and also have Proficiency over Unarmed Strike Attacks. Also, your Character's Size can either be based off of Character Creation, or the Pokemon's Average Size up to a size limit based off the Pokepedia page.** **Finally, like other Pokemon, you have elemental resistances and weaknesses while also being affected by certain weathered/elemental environments.**

	- **Anthropomorphic -** _Pokemon! Pocket Monsters! Pokemon are the champions!_ While looking somewhat like any other Feral Pokemon, you seem to have a level of intelligence that surpasses normal Pokemon, giving you the ability to speak languages from another species, and even wield basic Melee weapons based upon your size. **Anthro Pokemon can use Light Weapons if they're Medium or smaller-sized, while Large-Very Large Anthros can use Heavy Weapons. Also, your Character's Size can either be based off of Character Creation, or the Pokemon's Average Size up to a size limit based off the Pokepedia page.** **Finally, like other Pokemon, you have elemental resistances and weaknesses while also being affected by certain weathered/elemental environments.**

	- **Furryfied -** _[Insert Pokemon name] is one of the most suitable Pokemon for se-_ You're one of the unnaturally-built Pokemon in terms that you look more like an over/under-sized human with a Pokemon's head and tail- maybe even having tauric/naga-like aspects to your form. **Furryfied Pokemon are capable of using 1 additional category of weaponry with Proficiency and 1 additional Mastery over a weapon. Also, your Character's Size can either be based off of Character Creation, or the Pokemon's Average Size up to a size limit based off the Pokepedia page. Finally, like other Pokemon, you have elemental resistances and weaknesses while also being affected by certain weathered/elemental environments.**
- Furryfied and Anthropomorphic Pokemon cannot be caught by other Trainers with Pokeballs due to their slightly differing DNA; they can only be caught through consent and trust, being born and registered as the Trainer's pokemon, or temporarily befriended using Pokemon Ranger Gear.
- Pokemon can gain access to their full Movelists with no limitations of what Moves they have access to during combat unless the Pokemon is performing in a Tournament, Gym Challenge, or Elite 4 & Champion Battles. Moves still have to be earned through EXP expenditure, gained like a Trait (Spend 10 EXP for 1 Move), and must be earned in order or Levels; if multiple Moves are gained at the same Level, the EXP cost to gain the extra Moves simultaneously cost 0.5x for each additional Move (additional 5EXP per additional Move); Pokemon with Evolution-exclusive Moves can be attained later through Training with a Pokemon of the same Evolution with access to the Move.
- Depending upon the effect of a Pokemon Move has, it can cause damage to terrain/objects and even break it whilst ignoring half of its damage reduction.
- Pokemon can't be killed from Combat unless a Coup De Grace or Finisher is performed upon them.
- Shadow Pokemon are created from heavy abuse so bad, they lock their heart and emotion before becoming enshrouded by that abusive energy and having their abilities be changed from what they once were. Shadow Pokemon resist all damage types by 0.5x, have all of their Moves deal 2x damage to all non-Shadow Pokemon, and each time a Shadow Pokemon uses a Shadow Move or has affection given to them once every hour, they lose 1 Shadow Point. Shadow Pokemon are totally obedient to those who own them, ignore any mind-affecting Status Conditions aside from Pokemon Status Condition Moves, and start out with a selection of Shadow Moves and between 100-300+ Shadow Points representing their abused heart.
  
  The number of moves known equal to every 50 EXP the Pokemon has, to determine if it can learn a Shadow Move check its entry on Bulbapedia (https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Shadow_move) to see if it's learnable by a Pokemon that can use the Move it's based off of, all Shadow Pokemon know the Move Shadow Rush, it can't use any normal Pokemon Moves aside from Shadow moves whilst it has Shadow Points, and once it loses all of its Shadow Points, all Shadow Moves are lost and each attained turn into 25 EXP for the Pokemon to spend. 

  1 turn after the Shadow Pokemon's first turn, the Pokemon must roll a Disadvantage Test with success between 3-6; if it fails the Test, the Pokemon must flip a coin, with Head causing it to suffer the Hyper Condition which causes it to ignore Trainer commands and has a chance for it to lash out against its Trainer, whilst Tails causes it to suffer the Reverse Condition where it ignores its trainer and every turn it injures itself with Recoil Damage.
- Only Anthropomorphic or Furryfied Pokemon are capable of naturally opening and throwing Pokeballs on their own with the understanding to release Pokemon from Pokeballs or catch other Pokemon with them.
- A Pokemon Flying or Swimming in air/water move 15ft slower unless they have the Proficient Flyer/Swimmer Trait

# CR Actions
Fuji's Pokemon System for TD6 has a special Mechanic for combat called CR Actions (Call & Response).

During Combat, a Pokemon or Trainer can forego using their Action to attack to consume it and gain a CR Action; when an enemy Pokemon uses a Move to attack your Pokemon, consuming your CR Action will allow your Pokemon to use a Move to counter an in-coming Move with 1 of 4 outcomes:
- Counter - Attack the enemy Target while negating their Move with a d6 duel, best of 3, with higher numbers winning, and the winner of the duel succeeding their previous Test or making their their Test to hit; if the outcome is a draw, both attacks aren't negated and the damage is halved to a minimum of 1.
- Block - The Defender braces and guards against the attack, reducing by 0.25x the amount with a minimum of 1; if the Move is Super Effective against the Defender the amount is reduced by 0.4x instead; if the Move is Not Effective against the Defender the amount is reduced by 0.2x instead.
- Dodge - The Defender makes a Disadvantage Test + 1 Disadvantage Test per hit multi-hit Moves would land to evade the attack, before choosing to either move or use a Move to retaliate against their Attacker, with the Attacker being unable to Attack back if they choose the Dodge maneuver.
- Clash - Risking taking more damage, the Defender clashes Moves against their Attacker (still needing to make an Attack Test to hit) before both combatants perform a Disadvantage Test to see if their attack is still succeeding. The loser of the Clash can make a Disadvantage Test to barely scrape past the Winner's attack then attempt to perform a Counter, Block, or Dodge, but failure results them in taking 1.5x more damage than they would've from taking the hit normally. Successfully Blocking a Clash reduces the damage by 0.5x. Successfully landing a Counter increases the damage the Winner will take by 2x.

# Pokeball Functions & Catch-Rates
To catch a Pokemon, the Poke Ball must make contact with the Pokemon in some way either through rubbing off against them, bouncing off against them, or being pressed by them.

All Tests made to catch a Pokemon are rolled at Disadvantage Naturally.

Pokemon have 3 variables that affect their Capture Rate:
- Pokemon Rarity - Normal Pokemon do not have any bonuses on Tests against being Caught, including Normal Pokemon with alternate formes; Alpha/Totem Pokemon gain +1 on Tests against being Caught; Psuedo Legendary Pokemon gain +1 on Tests against being Caught; Ultrabeasts gain +2 on Tests against being Caught whilst reducing almost all Tests made by other Pokeballs aside from Beast Balls by -2; Mythical Pokemon gain +3 on Tests against being Caught; Legendary Pokemon gain +4 on Tests against being Caught.
- Stage of Evolution - Pokemon in their 1st Stage of Evolution require 1 Test in order to be caught; those in their 2nd Stage of Evolution require 2 Tests in order to be caught; those in their 3rd Stage of Evolution require 3 Tests in order to be caught; those with more than 3 Stages of Evolution require 4 Tests or more in order to be caught. 
- Experience - Pokemon between 0-80 EXP have no bonuses on Tests against being caught; Pokemon between 81-120 EXP get +1 on Tests against being Caught; Pokemon between 121-160 get +2 on Tests against being Caught; every 40 EXP after 160 increases the required number of Tests to capture a Pokemon by +1.
An example of how many Tests is required to catch a Pokemon: Legendary Pokemon with a 2nd-stage Evolution and 500 EXP requires 4+2+8 Tests in total to be caught.

Pokemon can be called by their Trainer with 1 Action whilst returning with a Free Action, but can choose to resist being returned to their Poke Ball if they choose or evade the beam the ball emits.
A Pokemon's Catch-Rate is not affected by the number of evasive boosts they have.
Pokeballs can only catch Feral Pokemon unless specially designed to catch Pokemon of other kinds.

- **Pokeball** - Baseline Poke Ball; makes 2 Tests when catching a Pokemon.
- **Great Ball** - Upgraded Poke Ball; makes 4 Tests when catching a Pokemon.
- **Ultra Ball** - Upgraded Ultra Ball; makes 6 Tests when catching a Pokemon.
- **Master Ball** - The penultimate Poke Ball; catches all Pokemon with absolute guarantee. Does not guarantee being impervious to being destroyed. 
- **Fast Ball** - Catches Fast/Fleeing Pokemon effectively; if a Pokemon was running away from Combat during the previous Round, or if they were planning on using Moves that aid in Moving themselves away from a Trainer, this Pokeball makes 8 tests against them; if a Pokemon has 20 or more Initiative, this Pokeball makes 8 Tests against them; these effects do not stack upon each other.
- **Level Ball** - Your Pokemon's Experience affects the Catch-Rate; if your Pokemon's Experience is equal-to- or lower than the Opponent Pokemon's Experience, this ball makes 2 Tests against them; if your Pokemon's Experience is above your Opponent's but less than double the amount, this ball makes 4 Tests against them; if your Pokemon's Experience is more than double your Opponent's but less than quadruple (4x), this ball makes 8 Tests against them; if your Pokemon's Experience is equal to or more than 4 times your Opponent's, make 16 Tests against them.
- Lure Ball - Makes fishing Pokemon easier; when catching a Pokemon Fishing, before, during, or after battle, this ball makes 8 Tests against them.
- **Heavy Ball** - Catches Heavy Pokemon with ease; Pokemon between 0-220.2lbs (99.9kg) have 1 Test made against them with this ball; Pokemon between 220.5-440.7lbs (100-199.9kg) have 2 Tests made against them with this ball; Pokemon between 440.9-661.2lbs (200-299.9kg) have 4 Tests made against them with this ball; Pokemon between 661.4+lbs (300+kg) have 5 Tests made against them with this ball.
- **Love Ball** - Very good for capturing duplicates; if used on a Pokemon that's the same species as your active Pokemon, regardless of gender, this ball makes 16 Tests against them.
- **Friend Ball** - Great way for making friends!; this ball helps convince the Pokemon that the Trainer is friendly, regardless if the Pokemon was caught or not, forcing them to make a Disadvantage Test to maintain or lower their Hostility towards the Trainer; all tests made with this Ball are only performed with 1 Test and can't be increased.
- **Moon Ball** - Great for catching Moon Pokemon; Pokemon that evolve using a Moonstone are caught with 8 Tests with this Ball, otherwise only 2 Tests are made.
- Net Ball - Great Water/Bug catcher; this ball makes 7 Tests against Water and Bug-type Pokemon, whilst making 2 Tests against other types.
- **Dive Ball** - Great underwater ball; makes 7 Tests against Pokemon that live in water, but if the ball's being thrown under Water, ignore any underwater penalties while throwing and this ball makes 14 Tests against Pokemon that live in water, otherwise this Ball only makes 2/4 Tests against Pokemon in these conditions. 
- **Nest Ball** - Great at catching weaker Pokemon; this ball makes 10 Tests against Pokemon with 0 Experience; it makes 9 Tests against Pokemon with 1-4 experience; every multiple of 4 and lower afterwards lowers the number of Tests this Ball makes against Pokemon (e.g. 28 EXP = 3 Tests made).
- **Repeat Ball** - Catching duplicate made easier; if a Pokemon is registered in a Trainer's own Pokedex, the ball makes 7 tests against them, otherwise they only make 2.
- **Timer Ball** - The patient one; starting at 0 Tests, each Round spent in Combat raises the number of Tests performable by the Ball by +0.8, maxing out at 8 Tests; only whole numbers are accepted, and decimals are ignored.
- **Luxury Ball** - The rich man/woman's Pokeball; Pokemon inside this ball are exposed to a life of luxury, doubling any friendship-gain with their Trainer, only allows 2 Tests on a catch; a full team of 6 in Luxury Balls is a show of wealth.
- **Premier Ball** - And you get a Pokeball-; gain 1 for every 10 Pokeballs of any kind that you buy in bulk, acts like a normal Pokeball, just with a different design; nothing special.
- **Dusk Ball** - The Darkness is yours to capture; this ball deals 6 Tests against Pokemon in caves or at night, otherwise they do 2 Tests.
- **Heal Ball** - Share the care; Pokemon first caught by this Pokeball, this ball only doing 2 Tests, fully heals the Pokemon whilst removing Status Conditions; outside of Combat, Pokemon heal 1+(1 per 100 EXP the Pokemon has) per hour.
- **Quick Ball** - THINK FAST CHUCKLENUTS-; when used against a Pokemon on the first Round and Turn of Combat, this ball makes 10 Tests against them.
- **Cherish Ball** - Who...made this?; normally an unobtainable Pokeball with unknown origin, this ball seems to usually contain special gifts or special Pokemon inside them. Who left them there? Nobody knows, but as far as any studies are aware, they have the same capture strength as the common Pokeball.
- **Dream Ball** - Let's make our dreams come true; this ball makes 8 Tests against Pokemon that are Sleeping, otherwise they only make 2 Tests.
- **Beast Ball** - Ult-Roger!; this ball makes 10 Tests against Ultrabeasts, whilst making 2 Test worth 0.1 against non-Ultrabeasts, theoretically meaning you could capture a Pokemon with enough Beast Balls.
- **Strange Ball** - Strange metamorphosis through history; when a Pokemon captured from the Past or Future with ancient or future technology travels back to the present, the ball transforms into this strange ball and appears to maintain this form even with the Pokemon released; it appears to only make 2 Tests against Pokemon like a common Pokeball. 
- **Pokeball (Hisui)** - The first of many; an ancient Pokeball design, this Ball makes 1 Test against Pokemon.
- **Great Ball (Hisui)** - The second iteration; this Ball makes 4 Tests against Pokemon.
- **Ultra Ball (Hisui)** -  The third design; this Ball makes 7 Tests against Pokemon, but can only be thrown to hit with a Standard Test or lower due to its design.
- **Feather Ball (Hisui)** - Take to the skies and claim it; can be thrown 30+ft further, makes 2 Tests against non-flying Pokemon whilst making 3 Tests against flying Pokemon.
- **Wing Bal (Hisui)** - The clouds seem closer than before; can be thrown 60+ft further, makes 3 Tests against non-flying Pokemon whilst making 4 Tests against flying Pokemon.
- **Jet Ball (Hisui)** - Let's reach for the Heavens!; can be thrown 90+ft further, makes 4 Tests against non-flying Pokemon whilst making 6 Tests against flying Pokemon.
- **Heavy Ball (Hisui)** - These balls pack a punch; this ball can only be thrown from 25ft away, and only does 2 Tests against Pokemon, but when thrown at the Back of a Pokemon it instead does 3 Tests instead.
- **Leaden Ball (Hisui)** - This could crack floors if dropped high enough; this ball can only be thrown from 20ft away, and only does 3 Tests against Pokemon, but when thrown at the Back of a Pokemon it instead does 4 Tests instead.
- **Gigaton Ball (Hisui)** - Ignore the fact that a 10 year-old can lift and throw this with ease; this ball can only be thrown from 15ft away, and only does 5 Tests against Pokemon, but when thrown at the Back of a Pokemon it instead does 6 Tests instead.
- **Origin Ball (Hisui)** - The Legendary Ball, catcher of Origin Forme Dialga or Palkia, this ancient ball appears to only be designed to capture and tame the rogue Legendaries when their quarrels begin to bring about the end of all time and reality.

# Alternate Playstyles

## Pokemon Rangers
A Protector of wild Pokemon, they guard Pokemon from Poachers and evil beings from interfering with nature whilst calming and defeating Pokemon who cause trouble to mankind.
Pokemon Rangers are only allowed to have 1 Pokemon out with them at a time, who's considered their Partner Pokemon, and can imbue their Stylus with energy from an energy-Typing from their Move to befriend Pokemon more easily like normal Type-Weaknesses and strengths.
Pokemon Rangers get access to a unique 'Weapon' called a Stylus; a special tool for temporarily capturing Pokemon with the bonds of friendship and commanding them to perform actions for the Trainer in their time of need before releasing them back to the wild; this tool can free mind-controlled Pokemon temporarily or cause a Trainer's Pokemon to run away for 5 minutes. A Ranger's Stylus can be upgraded with material upgrades costing money, but have an EXP requirement before they can be upgraded to capture a Pokemon more-easily. A Stylus at its base has 5 HP, attacks made against it are made at Disadvantage, and they can automatically Dodge attacks and Moves with Standard Tests whilst moving.
When trying to befriend a Pokemon with a Stylus, make 3 Disadvantage Tests, with each successful Test adding 1 stack of Pokemon Ranger's Bond; a Pokemon with below 40 EXP requires 3 successful Tests to be caught; the number of Tests needed to befriend a Pokemon increases by +1 per 40 EXP the Pokemon has. 
Befriending is not the same as Catching Pokemon, and does not help you Catch a Pokemon later on with a Pokeball.

## Pokken Fighter
*Special crystals were found that empower the bond between a Trainer and their Pokemon. This Bond allows them to connect with their Pokemon on a deeper level, and achieve combat-tactics uncommon to most Trainers.*
Pokemon and Trainer only play in Command Mode, and the Trainer cannot Attack or use Items to aid their Pokemon, only evade danger and use items upon themselves. In exchange for this fighting style, Pokken Pokemon gain the Combo Mastery; their first non-move Attack is rolled at Advantage, when a Pokemon rolls a 6 on their Attack/Move roll, they may choose to opt to perform another Attack/Move to continue their 'Combo' whilst dealing 1 less damage for each Move they use in their Combos to a minimum of 1; each Attack/Move after the 1st is rolled at -1 Category on Tests to Hit, down to a minimum of Disadvantage Tests with successes on only 6s. Combo attacks do not consume additional Actions.
Accuracy Buffs and Debuffs do not affect a Pokken Pokemon's Moves or Attacks chances to hit.
Pokken Pokemon also gain unique non-Move Attacks for the sake of Combo Mastery; they have different functions, but most do the same amount of damage based off of the Pokemon's Base Damage:
- Jab - A quick attack, rolled with Advantage Test on Action 1.
- Low - A fast attack that disables Dodging for 1 Round, rolled with Standard Test on Action 1.
- Uppercut/Anti-Air - A predictive slow attack that knocks enemies airborne, rolled with Disadvantage Test on Action 1; is rolled with Advantage instead if used during a Clash and the enemy doesn't use an Attack/Move that attacks from the ground/below, is using an Aerial, or is Flying.
- Aerial - Jump and inflict a stunning blow from above, rolled with Disadvantage on Action 1; rolled with Advantage instead if used during a Clash and the enemy uses a Low, or rolled with Standard if the enemy uses a Jab.
- Slams - A slow but hard-hitting attack that hits and bounces an enemy onto the ground, leaving them airborne for a few moments, rolled with Disadvantage on Action 1 and deals +1 damage.
- Sweep - Hit 'em hard and low to knock them into Prone, rolled with Standard on Action 1; does not Combo into other Attacks, but Combos from Slams and Floor Throws.
- Grapple - Make a fast but obvious grapple on an enemy with 2 Disadvantage Tests; on first success, deals Damage, then 2nd success throws the Target in a direction of choice, otherwise only pushes an enemy back 5ft.
Pokken Pokemon also gain a Mechanic called The Synergy Gauge; a 100-Point Gauge, taking damage, and half of damage dealt to other Pokemon fills up this gauge until it reaches its peak. This Gauge can be activated once full, and can be activated outside of your turn as a Free Action to enhance your Damage by 1.5x, whilst reducing damage taken by 0.75x; during activation, it'll ignore 1 Attack/Move aimed at the user and protect them from harm until the end of the transformation. The Transformation lasts for 20 Rounds, using Attacks and Moves while in this state reduce the number of Rounds left by -1, whilst taking damage reduces the number of Rounds by -2. 
## Hisuian-Style Trainer
*An old form of live, Hisuian Trainers way of life was constantly under threat of aggressive Pokemon because they feared them as beasts; future generations no-longer have this fear, but they they've managed to maintain their traditions with their equipment.*
Hisuian-Style Trainers can craft Hisuian-specific gear, make Stealth Checks at Standard, and gains a 2x Bonus on Pokeball Tests when throwing a Hisui-made Pokeball at Pokemon who haven't noticed the Player from Stealth. Hisuian-Style Trainers also gain a +1 Category Bonus when Dodging Pokemon Moves.
