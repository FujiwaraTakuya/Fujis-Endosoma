#Pokemon #TinyDungeons6 
This is a booklet explaining on how to play as a Pokemon or Pokemon Trainer in the TTRPG system Tiny Dungeons 2; related pages: [Pokemon TD6 Moves](Pokemon%20TD6%20Moves.md#), [Endosoma TD6 Links](Endosoma%20TD6%20Links.md#)

# Trainer Creation
If you're planning on playing as JUST a Trainer, you create your Character like normal through the Tiny Dungeons system, but you also gain access to Trainer-only Traits, can add a Starter Pokemon from the list available below (or wait until they find their first Catch of choice through wild encounters) to their Character Sheet in their Inventory-Section as (-Pokeball name-:-Pokemon Name-) before giving the Pokemon themselves a Character Sheet.

## Trainer Functions
Here is an extensive list of benefits and drawbacks a Trainer has while their Pokemon is out in combat.
- While a Trainer has a Pokemon actively out in the world, all damage the Trainer deals to other creatures aside from Pokemon is reduced by 75% down to a minimum of 1.
- When a Trainer would take damage from an AOE attack, depending upon the direction it would be coming from, if a allied unit/Pokemon is in front of/above the Trainer, they reduce the damage taken by the attack by 50% down to a minimum of 1 damage/reduce the chances of a status affliction being taken by 1 Category. This does not reduce the damage taken if a Pokemon/unit is knocked back into the Trainer and pushes all units back into the same/nearby tiles.
- Trainers can choose to either move separately from their Pokemon or move alongside them; if they Move alongside them, they both share the same Initiative but don't act at the same time, whilst Pokemon moving separately will have their own Initiative rolls for combat; this function will be better explained below.

### Trainer Function: Team Mode & Command Mode
#### Team Mode
When a Trainer calls out or has an allied Pokemon to their side and chooses to have them in Team Mode, the Pokemon can share its space and sharing its initiative with its Trainer whilst maintaining their separate Actions. While a Pokemon is in Team Mode, the any Movement Action the Trainer takes must also be taken by their Pokemon and consuming an Action available from each or else they must transition to Command Mod.
While a Pokemon and their Trainer are in Team Mode, a Trainer shares their Action Economy with their Pokemon, but not vice versa; this allows a Pokemon to gain an additional 1-2 Actions performable during their turn, in exchange for both Pokemon and Trainer taking damage from attacks directed towards either of them. If a Pokemon  wishes to attack more than 2 times in a Round, they must succeed a Disadvantage Test or else the attack doesn't come out due to fatigue and the Action is consumed.
When a Trainer uses a Move action with their Pokemon by them in Team Mode, they move with the Pokemon's Movement speed instead of the Trainers to remain beside each other, or else they must transition to Command Mode; this means a Pokemon can help a Trainer move using their ability to fly, swim, or teleport.
#### Command Mode
When a Trainer calls out or has an allied Pokemon on the field and chooses to have them in Command Mode, the Pokemon remains in its own separate space and initiative to its Trainer, can act independantly from its Trainer, and can setup/perform Actions that can benefit their Trainer/allies more easily such as odd-angle Pokeball throws or grabbing and throwing Trainers up to high-up perches.
While a Pokemon is in Command Mode, it acts like its own separate unit on the field with its own Action Economy; during the Trainer's Turn, they are able to use 1 Action to command their Pokemon during their Turn to perform an Attack or Action without consuming one of their Actions before or after their Turn arrives/happens.
If a Pokemon owned by a Trainer has an Action remaining that isn't used as a CR Action, Trainers may perform unique manoeuvres (as allowed by DMs) to perform actions normally not performable alone such as throwing a Pokeball at your own Pokemon to have them launch the ball further or at a strange angle at another Pokemon to capture them if they're protecting themselves defensively from such attacks. These unique manoeuvres can be almost anything able to be performed between a Trainer and their Pokemon as long as it's admissible by the DM of your game.
# Pokemon Creation
Creating a Pokemon is like creating a Standard Character for a Tiny Dungeons game, but they gain access to Pokemon-only Traits during the creation process, through Heritage Traits they can either be classified as Feral, Anthropomorphic, or Furryfied, and depending upon which Heritage Trait they choose, they may have access to additional capabilities and effects only attainable to each Heritage Trait they choose.

Pokemon differ greatly to other creatures in the world of Tiny Dungeons/Endosoma; Pokemon have type-strengths and weaknesses affected by their Biology as Pokemon, and because of these weaknesses their environment or elemental attacks/magic can severely injure them worse than other creatures, or barely inhibit them at all, meaning common magic or natural environments can physically injure or inhibit Pokemon just like other Pokemon Moves normally will. However, due to the unique semi-stable nature of their effects and abilities on creatures outside of their realm, non-Pokemon creatures
