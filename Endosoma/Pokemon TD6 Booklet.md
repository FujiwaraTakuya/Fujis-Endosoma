#Pokemon #TinyDungeons6 
This is a booklet explaining on how to play as a Pokemon or Pokemon Trainer in the TTRPG system Tiny Dungeons 2; related pages: [Pokemon TD6 Moves](Pokemon%20TD6%20Moves.md#), [Endosoma TD6 Links](Endosoma%20TD6%20Links.md#)

# Trainer Creation
If you're planning on playing as JUST a Trainer, you create your Character like normal through the Tiny Dungeons system, but you also gain access to Trainer-only Traits, can add a Starter Pokemon from the list available below (or wait until they find their first Catch of choice through wild encounters) to their Character Sheet in their Inventory-Section as (-Pokeball name-:-Pokemon Name-) before giving the Pokemon themselves a Character Sheet.
## 1a: Create your Trainer
Whilst ignoring the Traits you gain for Character Creation (for now), use the [Endosoma Simplified Gameplay Guidebook](Endosoma%20Simplified%20Gameplay%20Guidebook.md#) or [Endosoma Detailed Gameplay Guidebook](Endosoma%20Detailed%20Gameplay%20Guidebook.md#) to create your Character.
## 1b: Add Trainer Traits (Optional)
Using the TD6 handbook on available Traits, [Pokemon TD6 Trait List](Pokemon%20TD6%20Trait%20List.md#), and any other list of Traits, add any available Traits to your Character Sheet.
## 1c: Learn Pokemon Moves (Optional)
Unlike normal Pokemon, certain beings are capable of learning Pokemon Moves despite not being Pokemon; instead of 10 EXP to learn a Move, it becomes 100 EXP and requires to be taught by another non-Pokemon Teacher who knows the Move, or a Anthro/Furryfied Pokemon Teacher that can communicate with the Trainer to teach them the ability and usage of the Move.
### Trainer Features
Here is an extensive list of benefits and drawbacks a Trainer has while their Pokemon is out in combat.
- While a Trainer has a Pokemon actively out in the world, all damage the Trainer deals to other creatures aside from Pokemon is reduced by 75% down to a minimum of 1.
- When a Trainer would take damage from an AOE attack, depending upon the direction it would be coming from, if a allied unit/Pokemon is in front of/above the Trainer, they reduce the damage taken by the attack by 50% down to a minimum of 1 damage/reduce the chances of a status affliction being taken by 1 Category. This does not reduce the damage taken if a Pokemon/unit is knocked back into the Trainer and pushes all units back into the same/nearby tiles.
- Trainers can choose to either move separately from their Pokemon or move alongside them; if they Move alongside them, they both share the same Initiative but don't act at the same time, whilst Pokemon moving separately will have their own Initiative rolls for combat; this function will be better explained below.
- While in Combat, if a Trainer believes their pokemon needs a new held item to help deal with battle encounters, a Trainer can spend an Action pulling out and swapping/throwing an Item to their Pokemon to hold; if the Pokemon already has a Held Item upon them, the Pokemon has to have an Action available to them in order to perform the switch, meaning if the switch happens before the Pokemon's turn they lose out on an Action afterwards, and this item-switch must be done within 15ft of the Trainer. If an Enemy Pokemon has a CR Action queued up, they can opt to spend it to deflect the item away/destroy it with a Move; if the Test made has at least 2 6s, the item is destroyed, otherwise is deflected in an area within a d8 space around the Trainer.
- Trainers can ride Pokemon equal or larger-sized than themselves, or can be dragged by Pokemon equal or 1 size category smaller than themselves; riding a Pokemon of equal size reduces its Movement by 5ft whilst being dragged about by a smaller creature reduces its Movement by 10ft. Mythical and Legendary Pokemon bypass these rules unless wounded below 30% of their Max HP, but still require to be equal or larger sized to be ridden upon or equal or smaller to be dragged about.
- Even if the Trainer's defeated, the Pokemon can act autonomously from their Trainer, but they can't take the Trainer's Pokeballs to call upon more allies or catch Pokemon.
- A Trainer's Pokemon can converse with other Pokemon with regular conversations to convince them with information, negate combat encounters with diplomacy, encourage/incite Actions to be taken against a group, and much, much more normally quite difficultly achieved between non-Pokemon and Pokemon.
- Furryfied and Anthropomorphic Pokemon cannot be caught by other Trainers with Pokeballs due to their slightly differing DNA; they can only be caught through consent and trust, being born and registered as the Trainer's pokemon, or temporarily befriended using Pokemon Ranger Gear.
- Any Trainer-commanded attacks aimed at an Ally or an area with an ally, intentional or unintentional, reduce the attack's Test by -1 Category.
- Outside of Tournaments and Gym Challenges, Players can have more than 1-2 Pokemon out on the field to aid in combat, up to a Limit of 6 out at once.
- Pokemon in a Trainer's Party can be switched out using their PokeDex as long as they have an Internet Connection. Pokemon can always be switched at a PC in a PokeCenter as long as it has power.
#### Trainer Function: Team Mode & Command Mode
##### Team Mode
When a Trainer calls out or has an allied Pokemon to their side and chooses to have them in Team Mode, the Pokemon can share its space and sharing its initiative with its Trainer whilst maintaining their separate Actions. While a Pokemon is in Team Mode, the any Movement Action the Trainer takes must also be taken by their Pokemon and consuming an Action available from each or else they must transition to Command Mod.
While a Pokemon and their Trainer are in Team Mode, a Trainer shares their Action Economy with their Pokemon, but not vice versa; this allows a Pokemon to gain an additional 1-2 Actions performable during their turn, in exchange for both Pokemon and Trainer taking damage from attacks directed towards either of them. If a Pokemon  wishes to attack more than 2 times in a Round, they must succeed a Disadvantage Test or else the attack doesn't come out due to fatigue and the Action is consumed.
When a Trainer uses a Move action with their Pokemon by them in Team Mode, they move with the Pokemon's Movement speed instead of the Trainers to remain beside each other, or else they must transition to Command Mode; this means a Pokemon can help a Trainer move using their ability to fly, swim, or teleport.
##### Command Mode
When a Trainer calls out or has an allied Pokemon on the field and chooses to have them in Command Mode, the Pokemon remains in its own separate space and initiative to its Trainer, can act independantly from its Trainer, and can setup/perform Actions that can benefit their Trainer/allies more easily such as odd-angle Pokeball throws or grabbing and throwing Trainers up to high-up perches.
While a Pokemon is in Command Mode, it acts like its own separate unit on the field with its own Action Economy; during the Trainer's Turn, they are able to use 1 Action to command their Pokemon during their Turn to perform an Attack or Action without consuming one of their Actions before or after their Turn arrives/happens.
If a Pokemon owned by a Trainer has an Action remaining that isn't used as a CR Action, Trainers may perform unique manoeuvres (as allowed by DMs) to perform actions normally not performable alone such as throwing a Pokeball at your own Pokemon to have them launch the ball further or at a strange angle at another Pokemon to capture them if they're protecting themselves defensively from such attacks. These unique manoeuvres can be almost anything able to be performed between a Trainer and their Pokemon as long as it's admissible by the DM of your game.
# Pokemon Creation
Creating a Pokemon is like creating a Standard Character for a Tiny Dungeons game, but they gain access to Pokemon-only Traits during the creation process, through Heritage Traits they can either be classified as Feral, Anthropomorphic, or Furryfied, and depending upon which Heritage Trait they choose, they may have access to additional capabilities and effects only attainable to each Heritage Trait they choose.

Pokemon differ greatly to other creatures in the world of Tiny Dungeons/Endosoma; Pokemon have type-strengths and weaknesses affected by their Biology as Pokemon, and because of these weaknesses their environment or elemental attacks/magic can severely injure them worse than other creatures, or barely inhibit them at all, meaning common magic or natural environments can physically injure or inhibit Pokemon just like other Pokemon Moves normally will. However, due to the unique semi-stable nature of their effects and abilities on creatures outside of their realm, non-Pokemon creatures take half damage from all Pokemon Moves aside from non-scaling Status Effects.

It's recommended that any creature of Large size to be kept in their Pokeball while traversing public streets in towns and villages, but Huge or larger creatures are mandatorily mandated to stay inside their Pokeballs unless it's for their job or for the sake of a battle.

In this game, Pokemon are born either Feral, Anthro, or Furryfied, but this Heritage Trait can be changed later on through a Ball-Transfer Machine and specially-designed Pokeballs which allow for visual/permanent transformations into other Heritage Traits.
## 2a: Create your Pokemon
Whilst ignoring the Traits and Heritage Traits you gain for Character Creation (for now), use the [Endosoma Simplified Gameplay Guidebook](Endosoma%20Simplified%20Gameplay%20Guidebook.md#) or [Endosoma Detailed Gameplay Guidebook](Endosoma%20Detailed%20Gameplay%20Guidebook.md#) to create your Character.
## 2b: Choose a Pokemon Heritage Trait
As a base, all Pokemon start with one of the 3 Heritage Traits mentioned below: Feral, Anthropomorphic, and Furryfied; this Heritage Trait isn't named in the Heritage section. They also gain access to 1 additional non-Pokemon Trait if they're physically applicable for it, and this is the Trait that is named in their Heritage section.
## 2c: 
At the bottom of the Heritage Trait, you list your Pokemon's Strength's and Weaknesses to damage-types, like so:
	Strengths: Fighting and Grass (x0.25), Poison, Bug, and Fairy (x0.5)
	Weaknesses: Flying, Rock, Fire, and Psychic (x2)
If a Pokemon is currently a Shadow Pokemon, above the normal Typings for the Pokemon, the following should be listed:
	 Currently a Shadow Pokemon!
	 Strengths: All Types
	 Weaknesses: None
	 Shadow Points: 
## 2d: Add Pokemon Traits (Optional)
Using the TD6 handbook on available Traits, [Pokemon TD6 Trait List](Pokemon%20TD6%20Trait%20List.md#), and any other list of Traits, add any available Traits to your Character Sheet.
## 2e: Give your Pokemon its Moves
All Pokemon gain access to their Level 1 Moves for free without issue, but any Moves gained afterwards must be gained through EXP expenditure; Moves must be gained in order of Level progression, but that aside, gaining a new Move is like gaining a new Trait in that 10 EXP must be spent to learn a new Move.

Moves learned through TMs require 2 successful Tests on a Standard Test when learning them to learn them permanently.

### Pokemon Features
Here is an extensive list of benefits and drawbacks a Pokemon has while out in combat.
- Pokemon have 3 Heritages they can be born into: Feral, Anthropomorphic, and Furryfied, explained as such:
	- **Feral -** _You teach me and I'll teach you! POKEMOOOON!!_ As a natural Pokemon, you don't understand how to use regular tools or weaponry, but as long as an object's simple enough for them to wield, they can still use it as a weapon. **Feral Pokemon cannot use regular weaponry outside of Improvised and Unarmed Strike Attacks, and also have Proficiency over Unarmed Strike Attacks. Also, your Character's Size can either be based off of Character Creation, or the Pokemon's Average Size up to a size limit based off the Pokepedia page.** **Finally, like other Pokemon, you have elemental resistances and weaknesses while also being affected by certain weathered/elemental environments.**

	- **Anthropomorphic -** _Pokemon! Pocket Monsters! Pokemon are the champions!_ While looking somewhat like any other Feral Pokemon, you seem to have a level of intelligence that surpasses normal Pokemon, giving you the ability to speak languages from another species, and even wield basic Melee weapons based upon your size. **Anthro Pokemon can use Light Weapons if they're Medium or smaller-sized, while Large-Very Large Anthros can use Heavy Weapons. Also, your Character's Size can either be based off of Character Creation, or the Pokemon's Average Size up to a size limit based off the Pokepedia page.** **Finally, like other Pokemon, you have elemental resistances and weaknesses while also being affected by certain weathered/elemental environments.**

	- **Furryfied -** _[Insert Pokemon name] is one of the most suitable Pokemon for se-_ You're one of the unnaturally-built Pokemon in terms that you look more like an over/under-sized human with a Pokemon's head and tail- maybe even having tauric/naga-like aspects to your form. **Furryfied Pokemon are capable of using 1 additional category of weaponry with Proficiency and 1 additional Mastery over a weapon. Also, your Character's Size can either be based off of Character Creation, or the Pokemon's Average Size up to a size limit based off the Pokepedia page. Finally, like other Pokemon, you have elemental resistances and weaknesses while also being affected by certain weathered/elemental environments.**
- Furryfied and Anthropomorphic Pokemon cannot be caught by other Trainers with Pokeballs due to their slightly differing DNA; they can only be caught through consent and trust, being born and registered as the Trainer's pokemon, or temporarily befriended using Pokemon Ranger Gear.
- Pokemon can gain access to their full Movelists with no limitations of what Moves they have access to during combat unless the Pokemon is performing in a Tournament, Gym Challenge, or Elite 4 & Champion Battles. Moves still have to be earned through EXP expenditure, gained like a Trait (Spend 10 EXP for 1 Move), and must be earned in order or Levels; if multiple Moves are gained at the same Level, the EXP cost to gain the extra Moves simultaneously cost 0.5x for each additional Move (additional 5EXP per additional Move); Pokemon with Evolution-exclusive Moves can be attained later through Training with a Pokemon of the same Evolution with access to the Move.
- Depending upon the effect of a Pokemon Move has, it can cause damage to terrain/objects and even break it whilst ignoring half of its damage reduction.
- Pokemon can't be killed from Combat unless a Coup De Grace or Finisher is performed upon them.
- Shadow Pokemon are created from heavy abuse so bad, they lock their heart and emotion before becoming enshrouded by that abusive energy and having their abilities be changed from what they once were. Shadow Pokemon resist all damage types by 0.5x, have all of their Moves deal 2x damage to all non-Shadow Pokemon, and each time a Shadow Pokemon uses a Shadow Move or has affection given to them once every hour, they lose 1 Shadow Point. Shadow Pokemon are totally obedient to those who own them, ignore any mind-affecting Status Conditions aside from Pokemon Status Condition Moves, and start out with a selection of Shadow Moves and between 100-300+ Shadow Points representing their abused heart.
  
  The number of moves known equal to every 50 EXP the Pokemon has, to determine if it can learn a Shadow Move check its entry on Bulbapedia (https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Shadow_move) to see if it's learnable by a Pokemon that can use the Move it's based off of, all Shadow Pokemon know the Move Shadow Rush, it can't use any normal Pokemon Moves aside from Shadow moves whilst it has Shadow Points, and once it loses all of its Shadow Points, all Shadow Moves are lost and each attained turn into 25 EXP for the Pokemon to spend. 

  1 turn after the Shadow Pokemon's first turn, the Pokemon must roll a Disadvantage Test with success between 3-6; if it fails the Test, the Pokemon must flip a coin, with Head causing it to suffer the Hyper Condition which causes it to ignore Trainer commands and has a chance for it to lash out against its Trainer, whilst Tails causes it to suffer the Reverse Condition where it ignores its trainer and every turn it injures itself with Recoil Damage.
- Only Anthropomorphic or Furryfied Pokemon are capable of naturally opening and throwing Pokeballs on their own with the understanding to release Pokemon from Pokeballs or catch other Pokemon with them. 
# Trainer Overworld Mechanics
Here's a list of actions performable by a Trainer outside of Combat:
- Throw Pokeball (1 Action) - Pokeballs have different effects while trying to catch a Pokemon; throwing one must be done within 50ft, with any additional distance or obstacle lowering the Catch-Rate by 1 Category.

# Pokeball Functions & Catch-Rates
To catch a Pokemon, the Poke Ball must make contact with the Pokemon in some way either through rubbing off against them, bouncing off against them, or being pressed by them.

All Tests made to catch a Pokemon are rolled at Disadvantage Naturally.

Pokemon have 3 variables that affect their Capture Rate:
- Pokemon Rarity - Normal Pokemon do not have any bonuses on Tests against being Caught, including Normal Pokemon with alternate formes; Alpha/Totem Pokemon gain +1 on Tests against being Caught; Psuedo Legendary Pokemon gain +1 on Tests against being Caught; Ultrabeasts gain +2 on Tests against being Caught whilst reducing almost all Tests made by other Pokeballs aside from Beast Balls by -2; Mythical Pokemon gain +3 on Tests against being Caught; Legendary Pokemon gain +4 on Tests against being Caught.
- Stage of Evolution - Pokemon in their 1st Stage of Evolution require 1 Test in order to be caught; those in their 2nd Stage of Evolution require 2 Tests in order to be caught; those in their 3rd Stage of Evolution require 3 Tests in order to be caught; those with more than 3 Stages of Evolution require 4 Tests or more in order to be caught. 
- Experience - Pokemon between 0-80 EXP have no bonuses on Tests against being caught; Pokemon between 81-120 EXP get +1 on Tests against being Caught; Pokemon between 121-160 get +2 on Tests against being Caught; every 40 EXP after 160 increases the required number of Tests to capture a Pokemon by +1.
An example of how many Tests is required to catch a Pokemon: Legendary Pokemon with a 2nd-stage Evolution and 500 EXP requires 4+2+8 Tests in total to be caught.

Pokemon can be called by their Trainer with 1 Action whilst returning with a Free Action, but can choose to resist being returned to their Poke Ball if they choose or evade the beam the ball emits.
A Pokemon's Catch-Rate is not affected by the number of evasive boosts they have.
Pokeballs can only catch Feral Pokemon unless specially designed to catch Pokemon of other kinds.

- Pokeball - Baseline Poke Ball; makes 2 Tests when catching a Pokemon.
- Great Ball - Upgraded Poke Ball; makes 4 Tests when catching a Pokemon.
- Ultra Ball - Upgraded Ultra Ball; makes 6 Tests when catching a Pokemon.
- Master Ball - The penultimate Poke Ball; catches all Pokemon with absolute guarantee. Does not guarantee being impervious to being destroyed. 
- Fast Ball - Catches Fast/Fleeing Pokemon effectively; if a Pokemon was running away from Combat during the previous Round, or if they were planning on using Moves that aid in Moving themselves away from a Trainer, this Pokeball makes 8 tests against them; if a Pokemon has 20 or more Initiative, this Pokeball makes 8 Tests against them; these effects do not stack upon each other.
- Level Ball - Your Pokemon's Experience affects the Catch-Rate; if your Pokemon's Experience is equal-to- or lower than the Opponent Pokemon's Experience, this ball makes 2 Tests against them; if your Pokemon's Experience is above your Opponent's but less than double the amount, this ball makes 4 Tests against them; if your Pokemon's Experience is more than double your Opponent's but less than quadruple (4x), this ball makes 8 Tests against them; if your Pokemon's Experience is equal to or more than 4 times your Opponent's, make 16 Tests against them.
- Lure Ball - Makes fishing Pokemon easier; when catching a Pokemon Fishing, before, during, or after battle, this ball makes 8 Tests against them.
