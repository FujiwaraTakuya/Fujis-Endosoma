**The special system that Fuji came up for Pokemon-like combat is what he likes to call: The Call and Response System.**

# Call & Response System
On top of attacking, all Pokemon per-round gain 1 CR Action; when a Pokemon-Character attacks another Pokemon-Character or a Pokemon's Trainer with a Pokemon Move, the Targeted Trainer's Pokemon or Pokemon-Character can use a CR Action to **Counter, Block, Dodge, or Clash** the attack. During a Player's turn, they may use their remaining Actions to gain additional spendable CR Actions that last until the start of your next turn, or until they're used in reaction to Moves directed at you or your Trainer.

This system can only be used if the the Trainer and their Pokemon can hear each other, meaning commands made by a Trainer can end up being unheard if they can't hear the commands or are unable to interpret their words, but there are Traits that can be taken to reduce the penalties such as having a stronger voice to overcome deafening sounds or certain Psychic Pokemon being capable of using active Telepathy to read their Trainer's thoughts during combat.

## Counter
If the defending Target chooses to **Counter,** both targets must then make a d6 roll to see whose attack attacks the other first; if the Attacker succeeds over the Defender, the attack goes through anyway; if the Defender succeeds over the Attacker, the attack is negated; both targets continue to roll a d6 as a best-of-3 to see whose the winner; if the first or subsequent rolls don't dictate who the winner is, and if the result is a draw, the attack's damage is reduced by half rounded up, with a minimum of 1.

## Block
The Defender can also choose to **Block** the attack using their body, reducing the damage taken to a **Quarter** rounded up with a minimum of 1. This damage reduction is reduced to a **Third** of its original damage if the attack is **Super Effective**, or a **Fifth** if the damage is **Not Effective.**  

## Dodge
The Defender can also choose to **Dodge** the attack with a d6 roll against the opponent's attack roll, avoiding all damage but only if the defender can roll a 6. If the defender succeeds, they can immediately choose to retaliate back with their own Pokemon Move, with the Attacker being able to do either of the 3 choices to respond but they won't be able to counter-attack after performing a Dodge.

## Clash
Finally, if push comes to shove, if the moment becomes Do or Die, the Attacker can choose to force the opponent(s) into **Clash** where you attack a Pokemon and force them to counter the attack with a move of their own. First, the user must declare they're making a Clash, then signal to the DM a target. Once the DM confirms the act being possible, the user must perform a Disadvantage Test to see if they can force their target(s) into a Clash, and if successful they cannot choose any other action than Clash to Clash against the attack, but if the user fails the Test, the target can opt to Counter, Block, or Dodge the up and coming attack as well as Clash. Once the Clash has commenced, the User and the Target both roll an attack of their choice like normal; if an attack will hit, the defending Pokemon can make a Disadvantage Test to just barely scrape past an attack and reduce the damage by 0.5x, but if the evasion misses, the attack deals 1.5x more damage. If the attack misses however, the opponent will take no damage from the attack. Also, depending on the attack radius of the Move being used to attack, the following combat-conditions will be applied:

- Melee Vs. Melee: The winner knocks back the loser by 10ft, but if it's a draw both are knocked back 5ft from the Clash-point and both take 1.5x damage. If both fail, both Attacker and Defender stay in their space after movement if their Move moves them.
- Melee Vs. Ranged: If Melee wins, the Ranged-User gets knocked back 10ft; if Ranged wins, the Melee-User is knocked back 20ft; if the result's a draw, both are knocked 10ft away from the Clash-location; if both win and are within melee range, both users take 1.5x but if not, only the melee user takes damage and reduces the damage to 0.5x the total; if the result is both failing, the Melee-User moves up to the Target if their Move says they do before taking a 5ft step away from the position they attacked from- but if there's no space to move, the Melee-User stays in place.
- Attack Vs. Buff/Debuff: Both users roll Tests like normal, with the winner using their move first even if the Move itself doesn't require a Test to hit; Buffers/Debuffers apply their buffs/debuffs first to themselves/their target before the attack comes towards them if they win, and vice versa.  


This ruling only applies to Characters who have Pokemon Moves on their Character Sheet.
