#Pokemon #TinyDungeons6 
This is a giant list of Pokemon Moves converted into the TTRPG Tiny Dungeons 2 Format. To see how to properly use this list, go to the page: [Pokemon TD6 Booklet](Pokemon%20TD6%20Booklet.md), and go to this page for all Endosoma-related links: [Endosoma TD6 Links](Endosoma%20TD6%20Links.md)

Most moves are performed as a Standard Test unless specified otherwise.
# Z-Move Power Explanations
Due to the unexpected complexity of Z-Moves and their power, the following bulletin was made to simplify things (Move Base Power + S.T.A.B. = Z-Move Base Power):
- 1-3 Damage = 10 Damage
- 4-5 Damage = 12 Damage
- 6-7 Damage = 13 Damage
- 8 Damage = 14 Damage
- 9 Damage = 15 Damage
- 10 Damage = 16 Damage
- 11 Damage = 17 Damage
- 12 Damage = 18 Damage
- 13 Damage = 19 Damage
- 14 Damage = 20 Damage

# Move List
## Bug
### Normal Moves
- Defend Order - The user increases their Physical and Magic Defence by +1 by using their underlings to shield their body.
- Heal Order - The user rolls half of their Max HP as a dice; the amount rolled equates to the amount healed.
- Powder - Covers a 15x15ft area of the user’s choice within 25ft in a combustible powder. When a Fire-type move enters the area, it ignites and combusts the powder, dealing 4 Bug Magic Damage to all caught within the combustion.
- Quiver Dance - Boosts the user’s Magic Damage and Defence by +1, and increases Initiative by +1.
- Rage Powder - Cover a 15x15ft area in an irritating powder. All targets affected by this Move can only attack the user for 5 turns.
- Silk Trap - The user spins a silken trap around itself, protecting itself from damage while lowering the Movement Speed of all attackers that touch the trap by -5ft.
- Spider Web - Cover a 10x10 area within 20ft in a thin, gooey silk. Anybody who enters loses -5ft of Movement every time they move through or are hit by the Move, and lose -1 Initiative with every hit but not movement through the Move. 
- Sticky Web - Choose a target within line of sight, then perform a Standard Test; Advantage if the target is half your own Initiative. You catch them in a sticky net which reduces their Initiative by -1 with every usage, and can only move towards the user unless a Normal-type, Fire-type, or Steel-type move is used to burn/cut the web. This can be used on multiple targets, but this Move can only be used once per turn. Attacking with the Sticky Web and Pulling targets closer are separate Actions.
- String Shot - Choose a target within line-of-sight and roll a Standard Test. You reduce the target’s movement by -10ft of Movement and reduce their Initiative by -3. Those who lose their Movement fully are stuck in a cocoon leaving them Prone and unable to attack without injuring themselves, and must now attempt a Disadvantage test to escape. Those who escape the cocoon gain all their Movement back but their Initiative remains the same. 
- Tail Glow - Raises the user’s damage with magical attacks by +3 with every use.
- Infestation - Choose 2 targets within a 10ft radius of the user and make a Standard Test for each; the targets are assaulted by a bunch of tiny non-pokemon bugs for 10 turns and taking 1 Magic Damage per-turn before needing to make a Disadvantage Test. The targets also can’t move more than 10ft per-turn with the Move Action.
