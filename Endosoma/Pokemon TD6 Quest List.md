# Pokemon Quests
These are Quests specifically design for Trainer-Pokemon interaction.
## One-Shot Stories
### Testing Tutorials (Happens several Weeks/few Months/a year before a Party is formed.)
#### Tutorial: Kanto: A walk down Memory Lane
On a historical tour, the group visit Pallet Town to sight-see the home location of the still-current Pokemon Champion Ash Ketchum, and learn a bit more about the start of his journey.

Visiting the path he took to Pewter City, before coming across a Spearow trying to steal an Oran Berry from an Oddish, before another 2 Spearow appear to start scratching them.

Upon defeating the Spearow, they retreat to a distant tree, giving the group a moment of reprieve, before running into an even bigger problem; a horde of Spearow spearheaded by a trio of Fearow. Players are instigated to run.

After around 10 rounds of running, if players are paying attention, a distant figure approaches them with a Pokemon by their side, before a large Elec-Web is thrown out towards the horde of birds before most are being struck with a connected Thunder which strikes most/all of the Pokemon before they collapse to the floor, defeated and dazed.

Turning back, they realize that the Trainer that aided them definitely isn't Ash, but instead a prior champion, Red with his Raichu. He'll silently nod to everyone and barely answer many questions before talking back towards Pallet Town as the horde of Spearow disperse. Just as the group's about to leave, they see a sparkle in the sky, and what looks like to be the visage of Ho-oh flying over creating a rainbow trail behind it.
	Encounter 1: **Enemy:** 3 Spearow; **Neutral Unit:** Oddish
	Reward: 3 EXP
	Encounter 2: **Enemy:** 100 Spearow, 3 Fearow ; 10-Round Time-Limit; **Neutral Unit:** Red, Red's Raichu

	Encounter 3: **Enemy:** 1 Caterpie
	Reward: 1 EXP
	Encounter 4: 1 Alpha Pinsir (+1 DMG)
	Reward: 6 EXP
#### Tutorial: Johto: Photography Panic
On a hiking trip in Jhoto in Azalea Town, they first visit to learn of Kurt's technique with creating Pokeballs and Custom Pokeballs out of Apricorns, before being swarmed by a group of nerdy photographers taking a bunch of pictures of the location before heading off to Ilex Forest to try and take photos of the mysterious, elusive Celebi.

Following the group, at first they do seem to be taking pictures of wild Pokemon in quite obtrusive and invasive ways, including anything they believe to be a Celebi, before getting frustrated gradually with the lack of progress and deciding to stage the encounter with a Kirlia in cosplay.

Upon being discovered with their attempts to make more forgeries, they'll challenge the group to battle to make them forget the information beside a Hypno and Drowzee. Upon their defeat, they worry greatly about their hobby being ruined. Here, players can choose to out them on their own blog being fraudsters, tell them to clean up their act and not fake it, or even be bribed quiet.

With the encounters over, the Party's about to leave before they hear a strange chime in the nearby forest behind them, followed by a happy Bree, before catching a glimpse of the mystical Celebi appearing out of a time-hole before flying off mysteriously through the trees.
	Encounter 1: **Enemy:** 3 Sentret
	Reward: 3 EXP
	Encounter 2: **Enemy:** Noctowl
	Reward: 3 EXP
	Encounter 3: **Enemy:** 2 Ariados, 8 Spinarak  
	Reward: 12 EXP
	Encounter 4: **Enemy:** 1 Kirlia, 1 Drowzee, 1 Hypno 
	Reward: 9 EXP
#### Tutorial: Hoenn: Harrowing Haptic Havok
Some scientists are hosting a convention in Mauville City demonstrating some brand new mechanical suits with special AI before a rogue scientist by the name of Doctor Roberty appears from the audience to hijack their work using Rotom.

The Players are encouraged to help Doctor Bright defeat his special suits and return them to functioning order while stopping them from damaging the town.

After taking all suits down, the Party has to deal with one final fight against the mad scientist and his Golurk, before he's finally defeated and begs for your mercy. Then he uses a smokebomb to escape, and is no longer seen by the group.

Turns out Doctor Roberty does this on, like, a monthly basis, and while it doesn't set the progress back too much, it can be a bit frustrating.

	Reward: 5 EXP
	Encounter 1c: Rotom Tax-Robo (Electric/Dark-Type)

	Reward: 10 EXP
#### Tutorial: Sinnoh: Snowpoint City Shadowed
Along the snowy mountains of Snowpoint, where people are exploring the open snowy fields with snowboards, skis, and snowmobiles amongst a ski resort, people are being deterred from enjoying the place due to the recent sightings of a non-Pokemon ghost haunting the mountains and 'cursing' those who dare approach; Players are only made wary of this info after they encounter a number of people leaving the resort after encountering the haunting visage of the forementioned ghost by the upper hills. Players are told by staff of the rumour of a white-cloaked, black-haired maiden chasing after people and hurling icicles at passers by.

Players can investigate the trail uphill by following the trail that was last taken using the company's snowmobiles. Some trails are easy enough to follow, but after some distractions from wild Pokemon (non-threatening), they see for a few moments that there are 2 trails that lead off from the original trail the group takes- footsteps made by humans, before a snow storm seems to break out all of a sudden.

Then, the snow maiden seems to appear, threateningly throwing icicles around them and trying to chase them down if they decide to run. Closer looks make them look strange, and uncanny; if they continue to stay, the icicles seem to fly in closer and closer to them, yet never managing to hit them. If the players approach the ghost, they'll start to back off, before threatening back with an ice beam.

If the Players land a hit, the 'ghost' tries to run away into the trees into another man, before it's revealed they were a Froslass owned by a Trainer, who they and their friend who owns a Castform were recording from behind the trees of their mysterious encounters. It's revealed they're trying to record a student Movie of the lively terrors people experience of the unknown, and their own lack of understanding to explore the truth. They make fun of the rumours, and make mention of how this idea took form after hearing about the recently resurrected rumours of this 'ghost'.

Suddenly, a shadow starts to hover over them as a giant, white and red ghastly form enlarges gradually over the trees and spooks the duo trainers and their Pokemon, causing them to run away from the problem as the group are now met face-to-face with the actual 'ghost'. It has a ghastly, wispy voice that appeared to be threatening all of them with genuine death threats as it slowly approaches towards them, and multiple choices of actions can lead to different encounters:
- Players show the ghost kindness and apology, causing the 'ghost' to take mercy on them and disappear, leaving only the faint visage of red trails hopping away amongst the snow.
- Players overpower the threatening ghost and cause the visage to disappear and run away, seeing a fast track being made while red wisps bounce amidst the snow.
- Players discover the Ghost doesn't really see them despite moving closer, then notice they can move around the ghost to eventually see the slowly moving 'base' inching closer towards the snowmobiles, discovering the Hisuian Zorua. If the Players make their existence known to the Zorua, the 'ghost' will be sucked back into their mane, and they'll look up at the group fearfully. This option will give the Players an opportunity to befriend, and maybe even catch the Hisuian Zorua.
Depending on the choices made by the Players, they may or may end up seeing and fighting a Hisuian Zoroark- an actually difficult encounter, which can be either be dealt with combat or releasing the Zorua and running away if the players injure/terrify them, or letting the Zorua explain to them they wanna stay with you. 
	Puzzle/Encounter 1: Mysterious Threatening Ghost
	Reward: 8 EXP
	Puzzle/Encounter 2: Real Ghost?
	Reward: (Peaceful: 3 EXP) / (Violent: 2 EXP) / (Friendly: 4 EXP)
	Encounter 3 (Optional): 1 Hisuian Zoroark
	Reward: (Optional; when Zorua defeated/caught unwillingly: 12 EXP) / (When Zorua caught willingly: 24 EXP)
#### Tutorial: Unova: Undiscovered Urchin
At the booming Castelia City, several events are being affected from theft of key items and equipment:
- A superhero scarf from a Superhero costume for a children's show called PokeRider Lo'Shao with his duo Lopunny and Mienshao.
- An orange, 3-pointed shades from a cosplay convention.
- A tree sapling from a Flower Show and promotion for taking care of the environment.
Player investigations should lead them to discovering 3 suspects at each crime- a mixture of Pokemon and Human suspects, but the answers to all 3 are Mienfoo, Zorua, and a Petilil. It seems like this happens quite a bit amongst the related groups, and usually they're bribed to giving their stuff back after finding and offering them a bunch of berries, which the Party's now tasked with handling. The groups don't know where they live and perform their operations, so they leave it up to the Players to figure it out.
Players eventually find the thieves in an abandoned alleyway secluded in a corner with a single withering tree surrounded by a bunch of boxes and thrown away items; the Pokemon appear to be living there, playing together, and also taking care of the tree to the best of their abilities until the Petilil arrives dragging the sapling over and they try to plant the new sapling into a space by the tree. Apparently, the Zorua was cosplaying as a Hero like the cosplayer, whilst the Mienshao was trying to dress up like a warrior with the scarf that was too big to fit them.

Players can do some of the following:
- Try to take the items back by force, causing a fight and a painful encounter between groups.
- Try to convince the trio to hand the objects over with the bribe, which won't go entirely well due to wanting to keep the sapling, but they will hand over a third of the berries back as a result.
- Explain the situation to the group to try and reach a compromise.
Any of the following situations will lead to the trio of Pokemon either going to the 3 groups they stole from, or joining the Party as members for each Trainer.
	Encounter 1:
	Reward: 5 EXP
	Puzzle 2:
	Reward: 5 EXP
	Encounter 3:
	Reward: 5 EXP
	Encounter 4: (Optional; if players violently challenge the Pokemon for items back: 7 EXP) / (If players deal with encounter peacefully: 15 EXP)
#### Tutorial: Kalos: A Historic Celebratory Reminder
Players have made their way over to Lumiose City- the heart of the Kalos region, amidst a yearly tradition: A Historic-filled event explaining the past of Kalos and it's great war, how it was, and how it left the country before its eventual recovery into the beautiful scenic sites it is now. They also host a student performance, food stands, tasting tents, and examples of old Kalos toys and machinery as a way of preserving the old with the new, and hopefully preventing another future war if possible. Their belongings have already been moved by Machops from their buss, and taken to their rooms at a Hotel they'll be staying at, so they have a bunch of free time to explore around before they need to head back and get acquainted with their rooms.

During the event, they'll take notice of performers on stilts walking around with a historic garb attempting to mimic the visage of The Old King of Kalos, with one of them, while tall, seem strangely standing-out amongst all of them all; wearing old and battered clothes from several decades ago- specifically a brown trench coat, grey beanie, brown tailcoat, black shirt, green bowtie, brown streaked trousers, and black and brown oxford shoes, walking through the crowds with a much different stride in their step. It seemed much more natural than the performers upon their lanky stilts, with each step sounding much fuller than every other as they make their way over to an archway, bending down underneath it to walk down to a much less unpopulated street followed by a Floette with a strange tri-pointed flower.

Ignoring the man, there'll be obstacle courses, Pokemon Battles, mini-games, Questionaires, and plenty of food vendors, but players who've noticed the man will periodically be given another glimpse of the same man roaming around the city with the Floette, seeming to be watching over everyone as he roamed about, giving players more than enough opportunities to interact with them should they choose to.

Upon speaking with the man, he'll at first appear with an intimidating stature, before speaking with a calm demeanour despite their looks; he'll claim he's just a simple old man from an older generation, with any conversations mostly leading to dead ends, answering any questions thrown his way before he asks if he can leave. He'll then walk away quietly amongst the crowds, eventually disappearing from sight as he walks away from the players.

As the events die down, and less people populate the area, the events taking place seem to take a turn for anew as an orchestra begins to perform upon the big stage, accompanied by dressed performers re-enacting the old war and the climax of it with fireworks and a lightshow. If Players are able to notice, the old man is there, with a saddened expression upon his face and being comforted by his Floette. Suddenly, a fight breaks out amidst some drunken patrons arguing over the state of the war, who could've won the battles single-handedly, and what the best flavour of pokepuff flavour that goes with Lumiose Galettes and Berry Wine; the fight causing some serious damage in the area as the local police are having a bit of trouble reaching en-route. Any trainers are being asked to help quell the fight, to which the players are encouraged to help out with things.

If Players beat the battle without trouble, Players who notice will see the old man reaching out to grab one of his Pokeballs in uncertainty before the battle ends, before feeling satisfied that he isn't needed. If Players struggle with the fight, the old man will call upon his Torkoal to use Stone Edge upon all of the enemy pokemon, dealing damage to them whilst lowering their initiative below the Players before retreating discretely from the battle.

When Players return back to the Hotel for the night, they'll discover the one running the entire building is the old man themself as he hands over the keys to their rooms and their lockers which he stuffed their belongings into. He'll wish everyone a much calmer day tomorrow and hope that they enjoy everything that Lumiose City has to offer, while hoping that everyone learnt a thing or two about Lumiose City's history.

	Reward: 3 EXP
	Encounter 2 (Less Optional): 1 Stunky, 1 Shuckle, 1 Gothorita

	Reward: 7 EXP
	Encounter 5: 1 Talon Flame, 1 Roserade, 1 Shedinja, 1 Smeargle, 1 Swanna, 1 Grumpig
	Reward: 10 EXP
#### Tutorial: Alola: A very Alolan Afternoon
Players are going on a lucky trip to Alola's Hau'oli City and Iki Town on Melemele Island; experiencing the open and accepting environment whilst wild Pokemon live around and coexist with humanity.

After a while of exploration, they eventual discover a Trainer running their Pokemon back to a Pokemon Centre, currently Poisoned and scratched up.

Following the Trainer's steps, they'll see a trio of Team Skull grunts intimidating Trainers into battles, but duelling them fairly in one-on-one combat.

Players are encouraged to duel the Trio 1v1, and after beating each one, they'll get frustrated immaturely, heal up their Pokemon, and start free-battling the group without giving them a normal opportunity to heal. If Players struggle greatly with the battle, Tapu Koko will speed past the group to hand all the Players a Revive before disappearing back into the trees, watching intently for the outcome. If Players beat the grunts without a feint, the Grunts run off, Tapu Koko reveals themselves, hands everyone an Oran Berry, before flying off like nothing happened.
	Encounter 1: 1 Zubat
	Reward: 5 EXP
	Encounter 2: 1 Garbodor
	Reward: 5 EXP
	Encounter 3: 1 Salazzle
	Reward: 5 EXP
	Encounter 4: 
	Reward: (No Downs: 15 EXP) / (+1 Downs: 10 EXP) 
#### Tutorial: Galar: Phantasmal Pursuit
Visiting Galar's Ballonlea Town, they're encouraged by the locals to look around at the beautiful forests around them and experience the lively naturalistic region.

While exploring the fauna they can occasionally notice the shy Fairy-Type Pokemon around, before spotting some strange glimmers off into the distant darkness.

Trying to follow the darkness, they encounter several Pokemon minding their own business before deciding to mess around or attack the players.

After making it to the final clearing, they come across the visage of a Galarian Rapidash, before being attacked by the beast with no chance for diplomacy until its defeat/near defeat, where it's revealed there's a 2nd Galarian Rapidash, and their child- a Galarian Ponyta. Judging by the size of the glows from before, it appears the curious Ponyta was watching the group from afar before getting spooked at their approach, thus running away to safety. Clearing up this mistake, and healing up the Rapidash, they'll understand the misunderstanding and apologise with a bow.

Since the players are effectively lost in the forest, being rather deep into the forest, they'll do the Players the favour of helping them out by allowing them to ride on their backs and back to the pathway they came from. After reaching their way back, the Rapidash and Ponyta return back home inside the Forest, their manes glimmering in the darkness gradually before dissipating from sight.
	Encounter 1:  3 Impidimp
	Reward: 3 EXP
	Encounter 2 (Optional): 1 Hatenna, 1 Hattrem, 1 Indeedee Male, 1 Indeedee Female
	Reward: 4 EXP
	Encounter 3 (Optional): 2 Phantump, 1 Oranguru
	Reward: 3 EXP
	Encounter 4 (Optional): 2x Sinistea
	Reward: 2 EXP
	Encounter 5: Galarian Rapidash
	Reward: 13 EXP

#### Tutorial: Paldea: Confusing Curriculum
The party visits Paldea's South Providence to hang out during an airy vacation-period, before having that time be interrupted by a child/new student of Naranja Academy being defeated in combat by a slightly older student and getting frustrated by it.

Players are encouraged to help the kid understand why there are so many older and younger-looking students at Naranja Academy by battling them, before eventually Namona rushes in on the scene to challenge the group to a battle- but quickly cutting herself once the student makes their feelings clear on the matter. Namona explains that not everyone was given the opportunity to be a Pokemon Trainer while growing up, so some people get to do it earlier because of their talent, while others are only able to show it later because of their life decisions. Why they're allowed into Naranja academy is because they're a very open and accepting school that wants to help everyone, and hopes that they'll do the same.

With that, Namona will help the kid with their battle-technique in the future, and if the players want to, they can choose to battle Namona with a handicap.
	Encounter 1: 1 Skuntank, 1 Muk, 1 Venomoth
	Reward: 4 EXP
	Encounter 2: 1 Espathra, 1 Bombirdier, 1 Hawlucha
	Reward: 4 EXP

	Reward: 4 EXP
	Encounter 4: 1 Armarouge, 1 Ceruledge
	Reward: 4 EXP
	Encounter 5 (Optional): 1 Pawmi, 1 Rockruff, 1 Goomy
	Reward: 9 EXP

## Main Story Options
### Kanto: Project Mew Tryouts
A group of publicly licensed Pokemon researchers and explorers are hoping to expand their current organisation (of 6 (3 adult, 3 teens)) to other regions, but need highly skilled researchers and Pokemon Trainers to man the station and find new hire-ees to make a new base and conduct research for between 1-3 years in one of the new locations, eventually performing the same recruitment with new recruits to either take over the research and allow the 2nd team to move to another continent to continue a wider range of research, or vice versa where the 3rd team establishes a new base elsewhere and the 2nd team continues their research where they are.
### Kanto: The Counter-Rocket Task Force
Despite the lack of rampant thievery and muggings as of recent years the Evil Organisation, Team Rocket, have still made appearances around the world and have caused more and more commotions that lead to the attempted or successful attempts made to steal others' Pokemon. With most Gym Leaders and high-ranking Trainers lacking the availability and time to battle them at a moment's notice, Government Officials have deemed it necessary by this point to engage this once public menace more seriously as they appear to become bolder and bolder by the day, going as far as to even illegally attempt the capture of Legendary Pokemon with advanced poaching equipment. As such, the C.R.T.F was formed by individuals hand-picked from a line of Officers, Trainers, and elected Individuals to participate as a form of Poke-FBI that'll need to be trained out on the field before they can take on the organisation and any larger crimes, but sometimes they won't be given the liberty of time.
### Kanto: The Legendary Dex
The party consists of a group of friends/Legendary-obsessed nerds/Thrill seekers who wish to meet together and have the ultimate aim of finding, learning more about, and maybe even attempting to catch Legendary Pokemon all around the world, with their journey starting in Kanto. Amongst the known and unknown, who knows where their journey will lead them?

### Johto: Through the skies and seas
A strange occurrence of multiple rainbows and resonant howls from the seas have been seen and heard all across Johto, leading some to the believe that something is wrong with Ho-Oh and Lugia, and that they require aid, or some other life-threatening event may be occurring and these voices and sightings are a warning to human and Pokemon futures, or that they had occurred the anger and wrath of these legendary Pokemon somehow and someone needs to pay the price- or somehow all three.
### Johto: The JSS V.S. the Invasion of Evil Organizations
Johto's been facing strange occurrences with new businesses or gangs attempting to move into the country, setting up bases of operation and leading to the Johto Workforce becoming overtaxed dealing with underlings causing problems everywhere. As such, a new Secret Service branch was being developed by the Government to tackle the Major Attacks being inflicted by each of the Organizations and put a stop to any developments and progressions to their influence.
### Johto: The Legendary Dex
The party consists of a group of friends/Legendary-obsessed nerds/Thrill seekers who wish to meet together and have the ultimate aim of finding, learning more about, and maybe even attempting to catch Legendary Pokemon all around the world, with their journey starting in Johto. Amongst the known and unknown, who knows where their journey will lead them?

### Hoenn: Total Life Enslavement
A new evil Organisation, Team Geigas, is attempting to purely take over control of all life across the world purely for the selfish intentions of one- going above and beyond to force their territory on others and attempt total enslavement of people and Pokemon alike, attempting a world-wide dictatorship that the Players must stop.
### Hoenn: The Invasion of Mystery Dungeons
Whatever work Team Geigas has put into fruition, their power has caused a strange distortions in the world that have lead to the development of realm-warping openings in the land, air, and sea which Scientists have labelled them as Mystery Dungeons. Their warped sense of room-building, and strange environments and traps which litter the entire room, leave most who enter disorientated, injured, starved, or some combination of the 3, while also losing certain personal items in the process upon their defeat. Is there any way to deal with these dungeons permanently? Research is still being conducted at this time.
### Hoenn: The Legendary Dex
The party consists of a group of friends/Legendary-obsessed nerds/Thrill seekers who wish to meet together and have the ultimate aim of finding, learning more about, and maybe even attempting to catch Legendary Pokemon all around the world, with their journey starting in Hoenn. Amongst the known and unknown, who knows where their journey will lead them?

### Sinnoh: Reality Distortion
It seems that the powers of Dialga, Palkia, and Giratina are beginning to affect the multiverses around the areas of Sinnoh as they cause unstoppable rifts to open up at specific yet random-looking locations and altering the world as we all know it; certain Pokemon have their typings changed, some gain new and lose old typings, some outright just change their colour for their normal or shiny forms to unknown degrees. What their quarrels are, are uncertain, but one thing is clear: Nobody knows if reality is safe or not with what's happening to all of reality.
### Sinnoh: Sinnoh Vs. Hisui: A clash of the ages
The recent struggles between Dialga, Palkia, and Giratina have lead to the rediscoveries of ancient pokemon that should've long-since been fossilized and left to myths of the past; ancient pokemon and their evolutions either being revived by the distortions of space, time, and antimatter, being brought forward through time, or from another dimension. With how distorted reality has already been left, these ancient Pokemon appearing to be staying regardless of the trio's interventions.
### Sinnoh: The Legendary Dex
The party consists of a group of friends/Legendary-obsessed nerds/Thrill seekers who wish to meet together and have the ultimate aim of finding, learning more about, and maybe even attempting to catch Legendary Pokemon all around the world, with their journey starting in Sinnoh. Amongst the known and unknown, who knows where their journey will lead them?

### Unova: Hybrids and Fusions
A recent exploration in both legal and illegal research has lead to the man-made creations of new hybrid Pokemon (Pokemon with mixed traits between 2 Pokemon of different genes), and the publicised presentation of Poke-Fusion devices (An item that can allow 2 or more Pokemon to fuse together to become one being permanently or until a reversal device is used to split up their bodies apart once more). With this new exploration in technology, and bio-engineering that's now been set loose in the region, the wilds are possibly even more dangerous than before as experimented fusion and hybrid Pokemon are out on the loose, capable of causing more havoc than others before them.
### Unova: Ghetis' Revival
Hearing of the story of Bill from Kanto using his devices and turning himself into a Pokemon, but later un-fusing to turn himself back, the Shadow Triad steal his equipment blueprints and try to kidnap N in order to fuse him and the mind-broken Ghetis in hopes it'll revive the mentally-crushed man to continue his work- but it's then revealed after the process that rather than fusing the two captured entities together, they ended up swapping bodies- and it turns out that the N they'd captured was actually N's Zoroark. Because of Ghetis' intelligence, he's capable of speaking as a human in a Zoroark's body, whilst his Zoroark in Ghetis' body starts off unable to speak other in normal cries, but later develops the ability to speak in broken English. Things now develop into a wildly unstable, and vastly more power-hungry Ghetis trying to gather power and learn their new body and abilities in order to attack and destroy N's Team Plasma before attempting to take over the entirety of Unova for the 3rd time.
### Unova: The Legendary Dex
The party consists of a group of friends/Legendary-obsessed nerds/Thrill seekers who wish to meet together and have the ultimate aim of finding, learning more about, and maybe even attempting to catch Legendary Pokemon all around the world, with their journey starting in Unova. Amongst the known and unknown, who knows where their journey will lead them?

### Kalos: Revival of a Destructive Weapon
A bunch of ancient blueprints made during the great war in Kalos had quietly resurfaced amongst the populous. While it's unknown where these blueprints originally resurfaced, individuals have appeared to make some use out of using them, either for personal gain, or something much more nefarious, and the Players are given the opportunity to try and handle parts of the conflict.
### Kalos: Jet Rush Kalosfunk
It seems that a bunch of delinquents have a produced a propulsion machine the size of a backpack powered through intense kinetic movements, and are combining it with roller skates, bikes, skateboards, heelies, scooters, spark sliders, and more to parkour, slide, ride, grind, wall-glide, air-dash, and even double-jump. The ability of most Police and Pokemon on the force are unable to detain these fast-moving, physics-defying individuals, up until the players manage to find their own special jetpacks.
### Kalos: The Legendary Dex
The party consists of a group of friends/Legendary-obsessed nerds/Thrill seekers who wish to meet together and have the ultimate aim of finding, learning more about, and maybe even attempting to catch Legendary Pokemon all around the world, with their journey starting in Kalos. Amongst the known and unknown, who knows where their journey will lead them?

### Alola: Alola Trials and Tribulations
While the traditions of Alola have stayed the same, some newcomers who're visiting or even coming to live on the Alolan islands are being quite negative to the existing culture, and either to improve the safety of said Trials for all participants (which in term reduce the difficulty of said-trials), make them more up-to-date with current day society and update the culture for the future, or stop the Trials altogether due to the danger the Trials can bring whilst keeping all Kahunas as peace keepers.
### Alola: Company Follies
Businesses are becoming over-confident and money-grubbing; large-scale corporations from across seas are attempting to legally but dubiously obtain land, build new buildings to industrialise parts of Alola for no other reason than profit and theft of resources from the land; a perversion of the landscapes and destruction of untouched lands simply for the sake of more green in their pockets. But not all hope is lost, for the people resist these efforts and attempts upon their homes and the world they love, leading to mistakes traceable back to the originator- maybe there's a chance yet.
### Alola: The Legendary Dex
The party consists of a group of friends/Legendary-obsessed nerds/Thrill seekers who wish to meet together and have the ultimate aim of finding, learning more about, and maybe even attempting to catch Legendary Pokemon all around the world, with their journey starting in Alola. Amongst the known and unknown, who knows where their journey will lead them?

### Galar: Gigantimax Research Studies
The Players have been hired to roam around using a specially-crafted device to detect readings of Dynamax energy and predict the oncoming enlargement of wild Pokemon in the Galarian wilds; they want the Players to try and record as many of these readings as possible before returning to them to possibly use that research to create a reader that can determine the differences between Dynamax and Gigantimax and thus be able to discover other Pokemon with the potential to Gigantimax unlike others before and make a brand new discovery.
### Galar: Legendz in the Making
Strange Pokemon eggs have appeared out of nowhere, and no-one appears to be able to hatch them. Despite detecting life in a Pokemon Centre, they show no sign of hatching despite the eggs. Some have already hatched, while others remain unhatched to this day, at least until Galar's Medievalist Events all across Galar, where each region of Galar spends a week teaching the young and old of Galar's old medieval practices during the ancient ages of knights and Pokemon. 

Their combat would've been similar to that of the ancient Ransei region, but documents of where and what the region was doing until then is a mystery to both Galar and the rest of the world as they no longer remember what their connections and history with each other were like, along with the location of the unique landmark. Even when Pokemon did aid in most of the combat, the knights themselves would put their honour on the lines and fight side by side their partners whom they formed a kinship with, and do battle until the other side would be stricken down, leading to a faithful re-enactment of the old events using a special polymer material that would be blunt to the edge, but still weighty enough to be used as a combative prop.

Unbeknownst to the Players, they'll be in contact with a strange unknown encounter with each egg and their chosen weapon.
### Galar: The Legendary Dex
The party consists of a group of friends/Legendary-obsessed nerds/Thrill seekers who wish to meet together and have the ultimate aim of finding, learning more about, and maybe even attempting to catch Legendary Pokemon all around the world, with their journey starting in Galar. Amongst the known and unknown, who knows where their journey will lead them?

### Paldea: Terastal-Temporal Instability
Even with the current research performed within Paldea, a sudden surge of power had blown through the land and a strange occurrence has befallen the people of Paldea; momentary rifts popping up in the wilds of Paldea and introducing strange Paradox Pokemon unknown even to the researchers of past, future, and present- beings that have no capability of existing within this reality, yet appear to be from a differing timeline akin to the science of multiverse theory. Something is causing these strange phenomena, and what's currently to say the safety of the region, is uncertain to say.
### Paldea: The Great History of Paldea
As Students of Paldea's Orange and Indigo Academy, Players are given a Year-long study-course to achieve 3 Criteria: Independent Research, Historic Paldea Research, and General Studies (Maths, Languages, Poke-Basics), each worth 30% of their total grade; the other 10% of the total grade is a Student's Journal used to recount the year they had over the course of the campaign, and all the things going on in their life during it, taking the form of videos, books, or imagery. After the year is over, the Course ends, and all Students are expected to score at least 40% on their overall work, and those who reach that grade pass the Year and move on to Graduate from Orange and Indigo Academy, allowing them to return home and/or venture around Paldea more freely than before. 
### Paldea: The Legendary Dex
The party consists of a group of friends/Legendary-obsessed nerds/Thrill seekers who wish to meet together and have the ultimate aim of finding, learning more about, and maybe even attempting to catch Legendary Pokemon all around the world, with their journey starting in Paldea. Amongst the known and unknown, who knows where their journey will lead them?
