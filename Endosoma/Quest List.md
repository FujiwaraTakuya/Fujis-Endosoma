#Endosoma #TinyDungeons6 
# Tutorial Quest
## Info
The Dimension-Gate Opens up before everyone in the Outer Ring of Baungdoly; some younger folks appear to be heavily bewildered by the sight while those of older dispositions seem to show no interest or some very comfortable curiosity as the Player(s) brought out into the world. They seem to start walking out of an egg-shaped portal in their natural attire as their vision stuns them for a moment before they see the world. A random civilian will greet the party to Baungdoly- the Central Capital of Un Premadatia-Procturia. Under the general assumption that the Player(s) a new Adventurer wishing to start a new life here, they’re immediately directed over towards the Guild in Central Baungdoly.

After they reach the inner circle and reach the Guild, it appears that the building is somewhat bustling with life with the occasional Guild Assistant walking past the Player(s) with books and folders. They’ll be asked if they wish to apply to the Baungdoly Guild as Adventurers. If it’s revealed that they’re Outsiders, they’ll receive an open invitation to join their guild for free. If they try to act like they’re from the world, they’ll be asked to pay a fee before joining their Guild, but since their natural currency won’t work, they’ll be given a test instead and be asked to sign a contract that while their safety during the test is guaranteed, the Guild will not be held responsible for the pain that will be brought because of it. After completing the Tutorial-Test, they’ll be handed bargain-bin equipment. After all things, the player(s) are given their first quest.

The players will be tasked to eliminate a small grouping of Goblins taking hold at an old, abandoned home per-request by the client; the location of the site used to be owned by an old warrior who passed away due to old age, and the client has been granted permission to refurbish the building to a combinational historical site-temporary camping spot for longer journeys for the public to use, but the squatting monsters are making it difficult for workers to approach.

## Short Details
Players can optionally take a tutorial to learn tutorial-basics; they’re directed from Outer Baungdoly to Central to find the City’s Central Guild and sign up. If revealed to be Outsiders, they’re given express-permission for free to sign up and get some training. If not, they’ll be given bargain-bin equipment.

After a training session, players are instructed to head off on a mission to defeat a gang of Goblins who’d recently started raiding smaller traveling caravans that were entering or exiting Baungdoly. They’d recently been sighted in East-Referiam after dragging a cart up a densely-packed forested area; they’re wanted dead or alive. The area looks heavily roughed up with tons of carved marks cut into trees to pull the their recent haul home- but as the player(s) start to to make their way through the trees, they start to hear crunching and crackling which turns out to be the cuts in the trees slowly starting to heal themselves from the damage they sustained, the tracks of their damage being slowly disappearing by the minute.

Their hunt leads them into a clearing close-by to the border of Rostrun; a decently-large hut made from wooden logs, thatch, wooden strips, dried grass, twigs, and stones; basic by all means, but sturdy enough to fend off the weather with simple repairs. While Medium-sized players can hide amongst the tall grass, with the hut being on top of a small hill, the perimeter around the hut appears to be cleanly shaven of plants and recently there was a very obvious trail of crushed grass that drags its way up the hill, around the side of the building, and into the back down what looks like to be a cellar. Further towards the back, there appears to be some defaced gravestones to a family of 4; 2 having been long-deceased over 80 years ago with one of the others being dated back to 40 years, and the other not even being given a date.

Success to lockpick or break the chest is a single successful Test; inside a chest the Player(s) will find a deed to the hut and land dating 60 years ago to a Sir. Chufferston, 120 Gold, some pieces of armour for Humans, a small pile of short swords, and a leg of spit roasted giga-chicken.

## Rewards

## Extra

If asked about Sir. Chufferton, he used to be a Knight that worked with the Guild; a very eccentric fellow with a fabulous mustache but a kind gentleman at heart who eventually left to live on his farm with his Wife. He worked as a mercenary across multiple countries and would travel around documenting his adventures in many journals that he kept misplacing.

# Rampant Murders
[Info]

  
  
  

[Short Details]

  

A flock of Blood Crows had recently taken over a barn; while general avian pest-repellants were applied to the surroundings, this has seemingly merely aggravated the avians even further as the destruction of handheld farm tools and even bloody assaults and mutilations upon some of the farm animals. Adventurers are tasked to eliminate the entire Murder from the farm, while offering additional rewards for an overnight watch to assure farm safety. If any crows can be caught, extra rewards will be offered to buy them off the players.

The quest rewards 1 Gold Piece [+3 Silver pieces per additional adventurer] for quest completion, +3 Silver Piece for each captured Blood Crow, +7 Silver pieces for each captured Crimson Blood Crow, and +2 Gold and 5 Silver pieces for every captured Glowing Crimson Blood Crow; for engaging in the nightly watch, whether or not the players engage the Optional encounter, Adventurers are rewarded 1 additional Gold piece [+2 Silver pieces per additional adventurer].


# The Sleeping Overweight Troll and Ogre
[Info]

  
  
  

[Short Details]

  

An Ogre and Troll have been rotating around the Main roads for trade and taking ahold of carts and horses for their hoards; having left their tribes and forming a impractical symbiotic relationship, they’re now hiding in the woods somewhere after their recent raid upon an imported fish-delivery including some very unique and difficult to prepare fish that most people tend to avoid buying due to their unappealing visage or difficulty of preparation. Re-capture of the probably remaining fish takes priority, killing the Troll and Ogre will provide substantial rewards.

  

[Player Count VS Enemies]

  

Overweight Troll [+1 Healing & +2HP for every additional Adventurer] & Overweight Ogre [+4HP for every additional adventurer]

  

The Quest rewards 1 Gold piece [+2 Silver pieces for each additional adventurer]


# The Dungeon of Fallacies
[Info]

  
  
  

[Short Details]

  

A brand new dungeon’s been discovered that’s baffling most intruders that attempted to explore its depths, even managing to claim a few lives in the process. A challenge is presented to all experienced Adventurers to complete the dungeon and provide at least 1 hint to completing a section of said dungeon that had not been given before.

  

1st hallway: Trapdoor [Measures 1st person; if next person heavier, make it newest baseline; if next person lighter, activate light trap door]

  

1st room: Fit the shapes into the hole [Everything goes into the square hole]

  

2nd hallway: Hissing hallway [Sprays comforting pheromones that leave people cozy but dazed ‘til the end of their next encounter]

  

2nd room: Pokemon Colour Matchup [3 stone blocks of Pokemon rotate 3 times; each are grouped by colour; step on each matching colour in the correct order to complete each phase]

  

3rd hallway: Arrow barrage [Hallway shooting arrows out in different directions on the map]

Final Room: Confusing elemental boss fight [In-depth explanations on Monster Sheet]

  

[Player Count VS Enemies]

  

Elemental-shifting Guardian [+3HP per additional adventurer]

  

At the end of the Dungeon is a Treasure Chest filled with a Magic Book and a unique sword; roll a Test to see if the Chest is also a mimic before opening.

  

The quest reward for completing the dungeon and providing a valid hint for future Adventurers is 10 Gold pieces [+1 Gold piece for every additional adventurer]


# The Monster Circus
[Info]

  
  

[Short Details]

  

At first there’s no quest; a Circus is in town hosted in Outer Baungdoly showing off a host of domesticated, still-domesticating, and trained performers for the sake of entertainment; when the main feature of the show is a no-show, this starts some audience commotion and after a bit, they instead initiate a plan-B which leads to them flaunting off a semi-trained Chimera with training.
