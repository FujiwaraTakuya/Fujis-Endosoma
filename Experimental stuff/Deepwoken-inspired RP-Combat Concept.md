# Prologue
***"The Gods are dead. No one is here to save us. We're all damned to seek an eternity of suffering until the Depths claim us once and for all as we are nothing but playthings to the ones who watch us from below. Some find solace in mundanity, others in the collective madness that comes from centuries of corruption from the unholy embrace that infects our lands. In the end, the Drowned Gods merely take plight in your endless suffering as you die, die, and die again so that you may one day escape this hell, or attain a glimpse of Immortality as: The Deepwoken."***

Those were the words written by a bored guy in his mid-20s-30s for a game that was quite the popular yet frustrating experience in the 2020s, but gained a massive uproar in popularity by the 2030s with the development of Official Nerve VR Gear that would allow a Player to experience the world of Video Games in a whole new light unlike anything that was experienced before. Wearing a biker helmet-type console upon their head, they lay down on their bed and start up the console with a voice command before having your nerves safely hijacked by the helmet to simulate the game inside your brain and allow you to experience that not only you could feel, but smell, sense, and taste everything the world had to offer to you- it was truly a masterclass of design by several gifted scientists and engineers to bring this product to the public. Many a game were designed using the existing engines at the time, but one that had potential, surprisingly, was Roblox with its surprisingly in-depth engine which remained wholly under the radar of most developers until some talented individuals were able to create truly impressive experiences with graphics, sound design, and mechanics you'd normally see in more common triple-A titles. And with this experimentation, came to the advancement Deepwoken NVR.

Set in a post-human civilization, humans are an anomaly to say the least existing in this world, with most humanoid originating from animal, fish, or insectoid origins, with the other races being a rarer kin amongst the populous, but not an impossibility. With the sea levels rising and most islands being swallowed by the depths of the oceans, sailing in this environment is the most common form of transportation amongst the populations of each city as barriers erected to protect the unprepared from the unknown in the vast oceans outside of the known Luminants. While laws and villages exist, assassins and bandits still exist and persist to bring harm to others, so there will always be hell around every corner, be it humanoid, or something you wished you never walked into.

The game was, ultimately, made more accessible to the player base due to its Roguelike perma-death nature not working well with the new system of gameplay, leading to a change in management, and a vast difference in creative choices for the gameplay. It's been 2 years since the release of the NVR port, and a sudden change in its code began to spread gradually due to the influence of an unknown Hacker with many faces, voices, and abilities, with no known name other than the attempted alias: Blank, but because their actions are that of a single player and most of the community being, well, the community, since they referenced their name as square-brackets, they've been dubbed BoxHead. Surprisingly tame, but Roblox censorships do be like that. They made a decree that changed the entire experience of the game unlike what it once was before: "-all stats are now uncapped! Have fun, while it lasts~" before leaving a group of players they assaulted upon The Isle of Vigils.

The world is changing; the gears shifting, perspectives turning, lives twisting into something else that it once was; the NPCs have been given life, content once hidden now exposed to the public in vast detail- all of the prizes now thrown in sight, ready for the taking... yet every hand falls too short. Even in groups, the follies of man won't allow these rewards to be retrieved so easily. While the changes to the world are currently unknown, surprisingly majority of the game has appeared to be left unaffected, and 2 weeks after the incident, all service was running again like nothing happened.

***While death no longer be permanent, the trials ahead are no easier than before- more so when you face the trails head-on instead of behind a screen. Think you can handle the horrors and misfortunes that await you ahead now? They certainly don't believe so.***

Power - A track of the Level you have in the world; to start at Power 1, which is a character creation requirement, you must spend 15 points on Core Stat allocations whilst spending another 10 on a chosen Attunement or a 6/4 distribution between 2 Attunements, totalling up to 25 Spent Investment Points (+3 & 2 from Racial modifiers).

To increase one's Power up to a higher stage, one must spend a total of 15 Investment Points on each Core Stat in order to progress. Over the course of the game, whilst interacting with the world, the environment, and engaging in specific activities you gain either Universal EXP (UEXP) and Attribute EXP (AEXP); Attribute EXP is specifically-gained EXP from performing actions related to your Core Stats which can be stocked and spent at your leisure, whilst Universal EXP can also be stored and spent at your leisure and can be spent on any Core Stats level to increase its level, but require 3 points per-point of UEXP to be equivalent to 1 AEXP. Each Core Stat normally starts at 0, and to increase its Attribute Level, one must spend Attribute or Universal EXP equivalent to the Attribute Level attempting to be increased to (E.g. To rise from Strength 0 to Strength 1, 1 AEXP/3UEXP needs to be spent in order to level up your Attribute; to rise from Strength 7 to Strength 8, one must spend 8 AEXP/24UEXP to level up your Attribute.)

At Power 2 onwards and each even-numbered Power, Players gain access to a choice of 2 Talent Cards from the Talent Pool and 1 Mantra Card from the Mantra pool, some Talents and Mantras coming with Stat prerequisites, and some without, with others having quest-requirements in order to be unlocked for availability. A number of Talents can also be exclusive behind their unlock-requirements, which may or may not lock you out of certain Talents in the future depending upon your choices. At Power 3 and every odd-numbered Power, Players gain access to 3 Talent Cards from the Talent Pool but no Mantra. However, at Power 10 and 20, you gain 1 extra Talent Card unlike the normal even-numbered Power progression. When choosing a Mantra, you can choose to forgo taking a Mantra to instead gain 2 more Talents instead.

At the maximum-cap of Power 20, one should have 325 Investment Points spent (Including starting-base of 25), and access to roughly between 57-67 Cards by normal means (Varying between Talent and Mantra gain through Powers alone.) All Core Stats. Weapon Class, and Attunement Investment Point numbers should be soft-capped at 75 until certain objectives have been performed; usually performing a specific quest now made available to them once their Core Stat reached 75, it'll take them on a live-changing journey that'll teach them how to uncap their Core State, allowing them to invest points into it beyond 75 and reach even greater heights (Note: You do not need to be Power 20 in order to find, start, and finish these quests). Once a Core Stat has been uncapped, even if the Player were to respec their build using The Shrine of Order, the Stat'll remain permanently uncapped, meaning the quest never needs to be performed again unless attempting to re-challenge an old boss for loot or combat experience.

**HP** - All players/humanoid creatures start with 10 Max HP.

**Posture** - All players/humanoid creatures start with 10 Max Posture. In Combat, Posture starts at 0, takes damage when blocking damage instead of parrying, and breaks when at Max, leaving the Defender helpless and Posture-Broken for 2 Seconds whilst increasing damage taken during this period by 2x the total damage; this helplessness can carry over to the next Round.

**Blood** - All players/living creatures start with 100 Max Blood. Taking damage removes points of Blood from your Blood Gauge, causing deadly problems if it's empty. This issue can be healed with rest at a campfire, but it takes in-game time to heal the blood back- around 3 seconds for each point of Blood recovered. Blood can only be healed while resting at a Campfire, and while the player's hunger is sated (above 0).

**Hunger** - All players/living creatures start with 100 Max Hunger. One can't be expected to go throughout day-to-day without eating something of sustenance. Hunger is reduced by 25 points every hour and 25 minutes.

**Thirst** - All players/living creatures start with 100 Max Thirst. Hydration is important while out in the wild, especially when crossing the seas where clean water is very difficult to come across. Hunger is reduced by 40 points every hour and 25 minutes.

**Tempo** - All players/humanoid creatures start with 100 Max Tempo. Outside of combat and before combat starts, Tempo always remains at 0. When a humanoid creature is hit for the first time in Combat their Tempo rises up to 45 instantly with successive hits after only giving 5 Tempo per-hi taken, and for every 25 points of Tempo gained, increase the creature's Ether generation per-Round by +1. At 40 Tempo, a humanoid can use their Vent to unleash and pushes all creatures back by 40ft, unless the ability is blocked.

**Ether** - All players start with 100 Max Ether. Players naturally regen 10 point of Ether per 4 seconds outside of combat. During Combat each Round, all Players Regen 1 point of Ether per-second,  and only at the start of each Round. The amount of Ether Regen'd is influenced by the player's Tempo. Other humanoid creatures unlike Players do not have Ether requirements, but instead have predictable attack sequences.

**Sanity** - All players/humanoid creatures start with 100 Max Sanity. Sanity will always start at 0 where one is sane, but as they're assaulted with effects that raise one's Sanity gauge, the only way to lessen and save one's sanity is by killing creatures from The Depths.

There is a 4th Category- Hybrid which is a mixture of 2 or more stats focusing upon physical elements of the weapon, and Elemental that consists of a mixture of Medium and Heavy weapons that focus upon Elemental Stats instead of Weapon Proficiency Stats, but since they're technically still Medium/Heavy Weapons, it'll just be labelled as such until further notice.
# Attunements
These are the elements a Player can control; they can manipulate the element it relates to, listed as such:
- Firecharm (Fire)
- Galebreathe (Wind)
- Frostdraw (Ice)
- Thundercall (Lightning)
- Shadowcast (Shadows)
- Ironsing (Metal)
- Cursechant (Cursed Energy)
- Toxinfection (Poison)
- Monstermorph (Monster)
- Mirrorshine (Reflection)
- Tectonicshift (Earth)
- Spectralhaunt (Ghost)
- Naturesymbios (Plants)
- Psychoblast (Insanity)
- Riverflow (Water - Minor Insanity)
- Spiritcry (Emotions)
Players can learn multiple Attunements at any time during the campaign, but at Character Creation Players can only learn 2 Attunements at the start at a 6/4 split. Any new Attunements gained outside of Character Creation start at 1 IP for free.

Attunements also come with Training Levels ranging from 1-5 to show the player's Mastery over their Mantra(s); starting from TL 1, to increase one's Training Level one must find a Master of their Mantra of choice and have them teach them their Attunement usually at the cost of a mixture of money, a material related to their Attunement, and the appropriate number of Investment Points invested into your Attunement- normally looking something like this:
- Level 1: Novice
- Level 2: Adept (20+) (Upgrade Cost: 1,000)
- Level 3: Expert (40+) (Upgrade Cost: 2,000)
- Level 4: Master (60+) (Upgrade Cost: 4,000)
- Level 5: Legendary (80+) (Upgrade Cost: 8,000)
- Level 6: Mythical (101+) (Upgrade Cost: 16,000)
The total cost for all training adding up to: 31,000
There are multiple benefits for upgrading your Attunements Training Level:
- You gain a +0.5x boost to the Mantras base damage and effects from Modifiers per-Training Level above Level 1 (Max of 3.5x)
- Mantras can gain additional effects from increasing your Training Level, such as Thunder Kick from Thundercall getting the effect Instant Guardbreak.
For combat, almost all Mantras have a cast time of 2 seconds (1 second of wind-up 'til the actual attack), but some can vary with duration, end-lag, and casting types that affect the way the Mantra is used. Mantras can also be only casted once per-round, meaning you can't chain-cast the same Mantra inside of combat.
## Firecharm
### Mantras

Properties: Summons an orb during its start-up, with the 2nd second allowing its user to Block, Parry, or Dodge during this Mantras cast; any creature hit by this Mantras cast is blinded for 1.5 seconds, rendering them unable to Parry during the duration, but blocking the Mantra before it hits negates the Blind effect.

Deals only 1 Fire Damage, 0 Posture Damage; Blinds for 1.5 seconds on successful hit and prevents Parrying.

Optional Modifiers: Aeon Logstones can make the Blind effect last longer; if you have the Concussive Flash Talent, all Blind effects dealt by Flame Bind also Dazes the creatures
#### Flame of Denial
Mantra Type: Support

Range: Personal

Ether Cost: 100 Ether

Casting Type: Ritual Cast

Effect: The user spends a massive amount of Ether to create a concentrated flame that condenses down into a small ball on their palm before forcing that flame into their heart. During the duration of this Mantra, the user can't be knocked out from damage at least once when taking lethal Damage, after which the Mantra ceases its activity.

Properties: Spending a large majority of your Ether, you create a flame that you insert within yourself to prevent yourself from falling unconscious due to combat and keeping yourself in the fight; this being highlighted by an ever-present flame glowing within your torso for the duration of the Mantra.

During the duration of this Mantra, at the start of each Second, the user regenerates 2% of their Max HP to a minimum of 1 HP per-second; this effect being increased to 3% with the Azure Flames Talent. It also restores the Sanity of the user an equal percentile amount.

While active, for 30 seconds (12.5 Rounds) or 37 seconds (14.25 Rounds) with the Azure Flames Talent, the next lethal attack taken that would normally Knock the user will leave the user's HP at 1 instead; when taking lethal damage, the effects of Flames of Denial retain its effects until 1 second in-combat passes where the user hasn't taken damage, after which the Mantra is consumed and ends itself (Think of it like Second Chance from Kingdom Hearts).

After the end of this Mantra, it goes on Cooldown for 5 minutes (75 Rounds).

Optional Modifiers: A great Modifier with this Mantra is using Vibrant Gems you can increase the number of times you can go down from taking Lethal Damage before getting up back to your feet.
#### Fire Palm
Mantra Type: Combat

Range: 5ft->15ft cone

Ether Cost: 15 Ether

Casting Type: Maintained Cast

Effect: Create a blast of flames in a 5ft space in front of you before it spreads out into a 15ft cone.

Deals 2 Fire Damage, 2 Posture Damage on Block; inflicts Burn on a successful hit.

Optional Modifiers: If you have the Wildfire Talent, you can opt to cast the cone of the Mantra at your palm and widening the cone's effect by 10ft, in exchange for losing the initial 5ft of Range and turning the 15ft cone to 10ft.
#### Fire Eruption
Mantra Type: Combat

Range: 10ft cone -> 5ft radius at AOI

Ether Cost: 25 Ether

Casting Type: Maintained Cast 

Effect: Slam your weapon into the ground creating a small crater, blasting your enemies in flames, before the user pipes their flames through their weapon and into the earth for a 3rd second, causing a build of flames, energy, and resulting in an earth and fire eruption that can blow back the guards of most.

Properties: Slam your weapon into the ground in front of you dealing Physical and Fire Damage in a 10ft cone before the area where the weapon is embedded into during the 3rd second of the Mantra to erupt in a 5ft radius circle with Fire Damage, dealing a ton of Posture Damage with the eruption. During the 3rd second of the Mantra, gain Hyper-Armour to basic attacks.

Deals 2 Physical Damage, 2 Fire Damage, 2 Posture Damage,  3 Fire Damage with the second explosion, 5 Posture Damage with the second explosion on block; inflicts Burn on a successful hit.

Optional Modifiers: Can use Glass/Magnifying Stones to increase the size of the Explosion part of the Mantra.
#### Fire Forge
Mantra Type: Combat

Range: 50ft

Ether Cost: 20 Ether

Casting Type: Summoned Cast

Effect: Create 3 flaming daggers that can be used in any manner within 4 seconds of summoning other than a typical weapon as they break 1 second after making contact with any surface; while they don't do much damage, their usage and utility can surprise the cocky.

Properties: Create 3 hand-held projectiles the player can throw, stab, or slash with before breaking 1 second after being used. Each dagger lasts 4 seconds, meaning they exist as objects for 1 round until they touch something other than the summoner of the Mantra, and fly straight when thrown before dissipating once travelling their max distance from the user.

When thrown, the user can usually throw all 3 daggers at once in a thin cone-like shape, travelling 10ft close by before splitting outwards to a 5ft spread, repeating this spread until the daggers travel their full distance or hit something. The user can, however, throw them individually instead of simultaneously, separating them into 1 dagger thrown every second for 3 seconds worth of attacks.

Deals 1 Fire Damage per-dagger, 1 Posture Damage per-dagger; can break objects/walls on contact; doesn't inflict Burn on a successful hit.

Optional Modifiers: Can be modified with Crystal/Perfect Lenses to make the daggers fly faster and thus fly father; if the user has the Hell's Partisan Talent, it'll allow the user to inflict Burn with the Mantra; if Modified with the Tornado Spark, during the start-up the user spins around rapidly before throwing out 5 daggers in rapid succession in a straight line.
#### Graceful Flame
Mantra Type: Support

Range: personal / 15ft

Ether Cost: 60 Ether

Casting Type: Ritual Cast

Effect: Create a special long-lasting flame that acts like a campfire for self-healing, resting, and cooking.

The Mantra lasts 1 minute (15 Rounds) without Modifiers, and heals every non-NPC within its passive range 1 HP every 4 seconds.

When used in Layer 1 of The Depths, this Mantra can't be used unless the user has the Undying Flame Talent, and is completely unusable within Layer 2 of The Depths.

Optional Modifiers: 
#### Relentless Flames
Mantra Type: Combat

Range: 10ft semi-circle-radius

Ether Cost: 40 Ether

Casting Type: Maintained Cast

Effect: The user creates a hilted blade of flames around your your weapon before slashing 7 times in quick succession before the blade dissipates. 

If you miss the first strike, however, the entire Mantra is cancelled, and if any of the other 6 swings are parried, the Mantra is also cancelled.

Properties: While a flame cloaks your weapon like a blade, regardless of its size, it'll emit a 10ft flaming slash with each swing it makes, striking all within its radius, attacking 3 times per-second with Fire Damage for a total of 7 strikes; depending upon the Range of your Weapon, enemies within the range of your weapon's max Range also take Physical Damage from your Weapon.

In order to do the full Mantra, the first swing of the Mantra must hit or be blocked against to commit to the full Mantra, otherwise a missed or Parried swing cancels the entire Mantra whilst still consuming Ether.

Deals 2 Fire Damage per-strike, 3 Posture Damage per-strike on Block; inflicts Burn on successful hit; any number of Strikes can be cancelled to end the Mantra early and commit to other actions, but this doesn't refund any Ether for doing so.

Ether Cost: 30 Ether

Casting Type: Summon Cast

Deals 2 Fire Damage per-fireball, 1 Posture Damage on block; Parrying this Mantra doesn't cause it to cease its existence; does not inflict Burn on a successful hit.

Optional Modifiers: Modifying with a Magnet Spark turns the Mantra into a Turret that follows the player from behind; using Glass/Magnifying stones can increase the distance it travels per-second, and Aeon/Eternal Logstones can increase its Duration to give it more attacks while still travelling an additional 5ft every 2 seconds added to its Duration.
#### Rising Flame
Mantra Type: Combat

Range: 5ft-radius & 10ft

Ether Cost: 40 Ether

Moments after launching yourself into the air, roll 1d10 with each number equating to the number of Flaming Slashes thrown out while spinning, with each Flaming Slash flying out 10ft before dissipating whilst guaranteeing anybody within 5ft to take 5 Physical Damage from spinning their weapon and striking everyone around them.

After flying up 20ft into the air, the user and those around them gain Air-Time for 3 seconds, functioning like the Uppercut Action.

This Mantra does not negate any fall damage taken if you fall lower than your starting height.

If cast with your legs covered in water up to your knees, this Mantra loses its 5ft radius blast and its ability to deal damage until your legs aren't submerged in water, but you can still propel yourself skywards.

Range: 5ft range ->5ft radius

Ether Cost: 60 Ether

Casting Type: Maintained Cast

Effect: The user clenches their fist tightly, sealing a growing flame that compresses with their grip  and barely emits its flames through leaking sparks during the charge-up, with the first punch causing an explosion upon impact whilst causing a 2nd explosion of flames afterwards and causing the dust, dirt, and stone to erupt around them.

Properties: Acts similarly to Fire Eruption but only has a cast-time of 2 seconds with only a minor millisecond lag between the 2 explosions; the punch dealing Strength Mantra Damage whilst each explosion deals Fire Damage.

Effect: Using both hands, using your middle, index fingers, and thumb to act as your bow, and your other pinched fingers to act like the drawstring, you create a flaming arrow between the two whilst aiming at a single target and charging the flame to become more powerful.

Properties: You create a flaming bow and arrow with your hands and fingers, charging up an arrow of flames up to 6 times before firing out the arrow; if struck while charging, the whole Mantra is cancelled and the Ether is still consumed. On max-charge, the arrow is fired automatically, or 10 Ether is consumed per-second to keep the arrow maintained, but this does not increase the damage of the Mantra further.

Each second spent charging each charge of Flame Ballista after start-up increases the base-damage of the Mantra by a +1x multiplier up to a max multiplier of x6, this also applies to Posture Damage. The arrow can be fired immediately at any point after the first charge to deal damage to an enemy. Also, arrows can track after their target, reducing their bonus to Dodges by -1.

Deals 5 Fire Damage, 5 Posture Damage; inflicts Burn on a successful hit.

Instead of dissipating on Block, the arrow ricochets and randomly flies off in a random direction rolled with a 1d8; rolling a 2 makes the arrow fly into the air for 4 rounds before falling back down another 4 rounds later and striking whoever's below.

Optional Modifiers: If Modified with a Spring Spark, while the user is in the air, they can use this Mantra to slow their descent down by 5ft every 2 seconds before falling back to normal speed after firing the arrow.

Ether Cost: 60 Ether

Casting Type: Maintained Cast

Effect: Create a whip of flames before swirling the whip around twice before grabbing the closest creature and lifting them up to the air above you, then slamming them down to the ground in-front of you whilst causing a small crater and flaming explosion.

Properties: The whip deals Fire Damage 2 times with each 360-spinning swing before grabbing the closest target in-range, bypassing Block to grab your opponent before slamming them down with Strength Mantra Damage and causing an explosion of Fire Damage on-impact with the ground. The slam-part of the Mantra does not cause the target to become Prone.

Deals 3 Fire Damage per-flame whip strike, 2 Posture Damage on block on the first whip strike, Strength Mantra Damage on floor slam, 6 Fire Damage from explosion; inflicts Burn on a successful hit.

## Mantra Modifiers
Mantras are the memories, teachings, and ability to create and use special techniques by past Masters of the Attunements. One can Recall that memory of the Mantra to later give it benefits with Mantra Modifiers to enhance the technique further than normal, or even give them special abilities or change how they work completely. 

Mantra Modifiers are special items that you can gain over the course of the campaign that help apply additional benefits and downsides to your Mantra depending on the technique itself and the Modifiers being applied to it, with certain Modifiers giving neutral benefits whilst others give unique benefits like creating more summonable projectiles whilst using the attack or changing the way a Mantra fundamentally works overall.

Here's the basic-list of effects that a Modifier can do to affect Mantras without giving unique effects:

- Stratus Stone - +10ft to Width of Mantra, +20 Ether Cost

- Creative Action - Once per-round, depending upon the complexity of a desired Creative Action, a Player can request the DM the ability to perform a set of actions in a sequence that can be performed between 1-4 seconds out of the available Actions mentioned up above, enabling to perform more complex manoeuvres which can yield surprising results if you have an idea and want to act upon it. Note that Creative Actions won't allow you to perform Quick Attacks more often than the allotted combat-speed will allow for each weapon, but can offer ways to surpass difficult enemies and their abilities or protective capabilities.

# Combat Explained
## Combat Part 1: Round 1: Battle-Start
All Players and NPCs acting as participants will start off combat simultaneously unless the following is acted upon:
- Ambush takes the player/NPC by surprise
- Aware of an Ambush and pre-planning a course of action against the Ambush
- NPCs are given the highest Initiative for their 1st/Scripted Actions before giving them a normal Initiative
- Players are given advanced Initiatives for certain criteria
- Certain Talents affect the way combat is played
All Actions in a Round are performed in 4 seconds amongst all participants, with spacing being determined as 5ft = 1 Square. In a fair fight/duel, the distance between a player and their opponent is 10ft, but in randomised combat, distance can vary greatly depending on intentions, actions, and desires. In those 4 seconds, a player's Actions Economy to use Actions in that time is split up in the duration of what they can do in those 4 Seconds. Each Action has their own Speed, Duration, and Cost to use, so it should be expected certain Actions and Mantras to be faster than others.

Movement can happen any time during Combat, including splitting 
Moves between Attacks if both creatures are moving while attacking, but hit creatures lose all ability to move to new spaces, but does not disable their ability to evade/guard attacks.

Rounds only move on to the next once all available Actions have been chosen and taken.

There are 3 types of Combat-States: Assault, Attack, and Defence. On Round 1, all participants are in Assault Mode unless specified otherwise.
### Combat State: Assault Mode
All creatures in Assault Mode act Simultaneously to one and another and perform competing Actions in order to shift themselves into Attack Mode; their 1st Action will compete against each other for speed with those landing their hit first enabling them to act in Attack Mode on the next Round whilst putting their opponent into Defence Mode and continue fighting with their advantage. Those in Assault Mode can Attack or Defend semi-freely.
The Player who lands their 1st Attack upon another Creature in Assault Mode will immediately cease any Actions they had Queued up for their Turn during that Round. This also locks that Player and those hit by their Attack(s) into Attack and Defence Modes respectively. Those who weren't hit remain in Assault Mode until they've been hit/land a hit.

## Combat Part 2: Round 2+: Battle-Onwards.
From Round 2 onwards, if any creature is in Assault Mode, they'll act first and simultaneously at any target of their choosing; if a creature/multiple creatures are in Attack Mode, each must roll a dice with the higher number of the group dictating the initiative-order of each group who Attacks  and Defends first, whilst also making the ones at the top of that Initiative Order attack simultaneously with those in Assault Mode.

### Combat State: Attack Mode
Creatures in Assault Mode have active advantage fighting other creatures, being fully capable of attacking enemies to their heart's content whilst also maintaining the ability to Dodge, Block, Parry, Vent, and use Items.
If you're hit by an Attack or some other Action during your Attack Mode, you're automatically placed into Defence Mode, and whatever Seconds you have left in your Turn, with the next Second available being impossible for the player to Block, Dodge, use Items, Attack, or Cast Mantras, are turned into your Defence Mode Actions that you can designate in the heat of the moment before the end of your Turn.
If a Defence Mode creature successfully lands a Vent against you, you're both placed back into Assault Mode.
### Combat State: Defence Mode
Creatures in Defence Mode have a disadvantage in combat, usually placed in this state after taking a hit; during the 1st actable Second after being placed into Defence Mode, the creature can't Attack, Block, Dodge, use Items, or cast Mantras due to hit-stun, but every Second that comes after, the creature can Block and Dodge upcoming attacks that threaten them.
If a Creature in Defence Mode lands a Parry against their opponent's Attack, both parties switch Modes i.e. Defence to Attack and Attack to Defence, and thus the Creature in Attack Mode can now do actions only permittable in Attack Mode.
If you're able to successfully land a Vent against a creature in Attack Mode, you and all creatures within the radius of the Vent are pushed back and placed back into Assault Mode.

Combat will continue to go on like this until one side is all Knocked, Dead, Carried, all but 1 side have managed to successfully flee Combat, or a mixture of the 4.

# Combat Summarised
In combat, everyone starts in Assault Mode. Rounds last 4 Seconds each Round.
Each Action a player spends during their turn last a certain amount of seconds- either pulling off or how long until they land the attack, and each Action is queued one after another kinda like Final Fantasy 13. During Combat after queueing your Action(s), you can choose to perform an Action Break to stop your Queued Actions to setup a new set of Actions.
When a Player runs out of HP, they're Downed not Dead, and to kill a Downed person, they either have to spend 2 continuous Rounds being Gripped by another creature, or spend 3 continuous Rounds drowning in water.
