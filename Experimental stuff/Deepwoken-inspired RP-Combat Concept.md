# Prologue
***"The Gods are dead. No one is here to save us. We're all damned to seek an eternity of suffering until the Depths claim us once and for all as we are nothing but playthings to the ones who watch us from below. Some find solace in mundanity, others in the collective madness that comes from centuries of corruption from the unholy embrace that infects our lands. In the end, the Drowned Gods merely take plight in your endless suffering as you die, die, and die again so that you may one day escape this hell, or attain a glimpse of Immortality as: The Deepwoken."***

Those were the words written by a bored guy in his mid-20s-30s for a game that was quite the popular yet frustrating experience in the 2020s, but gained a massive uproar in popularity by the 2030s with the development of Official Nerve VR Gear that would allow a Player to experience the world of Video Games in a whole new light unlike anything that was experienced before. Wearing a biker helmet-type console upon their head, they lay down on their bed and start up the console with a voice command before having your nerves safely hijacked by the helmet to simulate the game inside your brain and allow you to experience that not only you could feel, but smell, sense, and taste everything the world had to offer to you- it was truly a masterclass of design by several gifted scientists and engineers to bring this product to the public. Many a game were designed using the existing engines at the time, but one that had potential, surprisingly, was Roblox with its surprisingly in-depth engine which remained wholly under the radar of most developers until some talented individuals were able to create truly impressive experiences with graphics, sound design, and mechanics you'd normally see in more common triple-A titles. And with this experimentation, came to the advancement Deepwoken NVR.

Set in a post-human civilization, humans are an anomaly to say the least existing in this world, with most humanoid originating from animal, fish, or insectoid origins, with the other races being a rarer kin amongst the populous, but not an impossibility. With the sea levels rising and most islands being swallowed by the depths of the oceans, sailing in this environment is the most common form of transportation amongst the populations of each city as barriers erected to protect the unprepared from the unknown in the vast oceans outside of the known Luminants. While laws and villages exist, assassins and bandits still exist and persist to bring harm to others, so there will always be hell around every corner, be it humanoid, or something you wished you never walked into.

The game was, ultimately, made more accessible to the player base due to its Roguelike perma-death nature not working well with the new system of gameplay, leading to a change in management, and a vast difference in creative choices for the gameplay. It's been 2 years since the release of the NVR port, and a sudden change in its code began to spread gradually due to the influence of an unknown Hacker with many faces, voices, and abilities, with no known name other than the attempted alias: Blank, but because their actions are that of a single player and most of the community being, well, the community, since they referenced their name as square-brackets, they've been dubbed BoxHead. Surprisingly tame, but Roblox censorships do be like that. They made a decree that changed the entire experience of the game unlike what it once was before: "-all stats are now uncapped! Have fun, while it lasts~" before leaving a group of players they assaulted upon The Isle of Vigils.

The world is changing; the gears shifting, perspectives turning, lives twisting into something else that it once was; the NPCs have been given life, content once hidden now exposed to the public in vast detail- all of the prizes now thrown in sight, ready for the taking... yet every hand falls too short. Even in groups, the follies of man won't allow these rewards to be retrieved so easily. While the changes to the world are currently unknown, surprisingly majority of the game has appeared to be left unaffected, and 2 weeks after the incident, all service was running again like nothing happened.

***While death no longer be permanent, the trials ahead are no easier than before- more so when you face the trails head-on instead of behind a screen. Think you can handle the horrors and misfortunes that await you ahead now? They certainly don't believe so.***

Power - A track of the Level you have in the world; to start at Power 1, which is a character creation requirement, you must spend 15 points on Core Stat allocations whilst spending another 10 on a chosen Attunement or a 6/4 distribution between 2 Attunements, totalling up to 25 Spent Investment Points (+3 & 2 from Racial modifiers).

To increase one's Power up to a higher stage, one must spend a total of 15 Investment Points on each Core Stat in order to progress. Over the course of the game, whilst interacting with the world, the environment, and engaging in specific activities you gain either Universal EXP (UEXP) and Attribute EXP (AEXP); Attribute EXP is specifically-gained EXP from performing actions related to your Core Stats which can be stocked and spent at your leisure, whilst Universal EXP can also be stored and spent at your leisure and can be spent on any Core Stats level to increase its level, but require 3 points per-point of UEXP to be equivalent to 1 AEXP. Each Core Stat normally starts at 0, and to increase its Attribute Level, one must spend Attribute or Universal EXP equivalent to the Attribute Level attempting to be increased to (E.g. To rise from Strength 0 to Strength 1, 1 AEXP/3UEXP needs to be spent in order to level up your Attribute; to rise from Strength 7 to Strength 8, one must spend 8 AEXP/24UEXP to level up your Attribute.)

At Power 2 onwards and each even-numbered Power, Players gain access to a choice of 2 Talent Cards from the Talent Pool and 1 Mantra Card from the Mantra pool, some Talents and Mantras coming with Stat prerequisites, and some without, with others having quest-requirements in order to be unlocked for availability. A number of Talents can also be exclusive behind their unlock-requirements, which may or may not lock you out of certain Talents in the future depending upon your choices. At Power 3 and every odd-numbered Power, Players gain access to 3 Talent Cards from the Talent Pool but no Mantra. However, at Power 10 and 20, you gain 1 extra Talent Card unlike the normal even-numbered Power progression. When choosing a Mantra, you can choose to forgo taking a Mantra to instead gain 2 more Talents instead.

At the maximum-cap of Power 20, one should have 325 Investment Points spent (Including starting-base of 25), and access to roughly between 57-67 Cards by normal means (Varying between Talent and Mantra gain through Powers alone.) All Core Stats. Weapon Class, and Attunement Investment Point numbers should be soft-capped at 75 until certain objectives have been performed; usually performing a specific quest now made available to them once their Core Stat reached 75, it'll take them on a live-changing journey that'll teach them how to uncap their Core State, allowing them to invest points into it beyond 75 and reach even greater heights (Note: You do not need to be Power 20 in order to find, start, and finish these quests). Once a Core Stat has been uncapped, even if the Player were to respec their build using The Shrine of Order, the Stat'll remain permanently uncapped, meaning the quest never needs to be performed again unless attempting to re-challenge an old boss for loot or combat experience.

**HP** - All players/humanoid creatures start with 10 Max HP.

**Posture** - All players/humanoid creatures start with 10 Max Posture. In Combat, Posture starts at 0, takes damage when blocking damage instead of parrying, and breaks when at Max, leaving the Defender helpless and Posture-Broken for 2 Seconds whilst increasing damage taken during this period by 2x the total damage; this helplessness can carry over to the next Round.

**Blood** - All players/living creatures start with 100 Max Blood. Taking damage removes points of Blood from your Blood Gauge, causing deadly problems if it's empty. This issue can be healed with rest at a campfire, but it takes in-game time to heal the blood back- around 3 seconds for each point of Blood recovered. Blood can only be healed while resting at a Campfire, and while the player's hunger is sated (above 0).

**Hunger** - All players/living creatures start with 100 Max Hunger. One can't be expected to go throughout day-to-day without eating something of sustenance. Hunger is reduced by 25 points every hour and 25 minutes.

**Thirst** - All players/living creatures start with 100 Max Thirst. Hydration is important while out in the wild, especially when crossing the seas where clean water is very difficult to come across. Hunger is reduced by 40 points every hour and 25 minutes.

**Tempo** - All players/humanoid creatures start with 100 Max Tempo. Outside of combat and before combat starts, Tempo always remains at 0. When a humanoid creature is hit for the first time in Combat their Tempo rises up to 45 instantly with successive hits after only giving 5 Tempo per-hi taken, and for every 25 points of Tempo gained, increase the creature's Ether generation per-Round by +1. At 40 Tempo, a humanoid can use their Vent to unleash and pushes all creatures back by 40ft, unless the ability is blocked.

**Ether** - All players start with 100 Max Ether. Players naturally regen 10 point of Ether per 4 seconds outside of combat. During Combat each Round, all Players Regen 1 point of Ether per-second,  and only at the start of each Round. The amount of Ether Regen'd is influenced by the player's Tempo. Other humanoid creatures unlike Players do not have Ether requirements, but instead have predictable attack sequences.

**Sanity** - All players/humanoid creatures start with 100 Max Sanity. Sanity will always start at 0 where one is sane, but as they're assaulted with effects that raise one's Sanity gauge, the only way to lessen and save one's sanity is by killing creatures from The Depths.

# Actions
These are the actions you can perform during Combat in no particular order, listed as such:
- Move - Move up to 15ft, Run up to 30ft, or Sprint up to 60ft (1/2/3 seconds; Sprint disables Quick Attack, Block, Parry, Quick-Equip, Throw, and Use Item.)
- Quick Attack - Perform a short, quick attack with varying speed amongst weapons (1 second)
- Critical Attack - Perform a strong but obvious attack with various offensive properties based upon weapon (2 seconds/varies)
- Uppercut - Evading an incoming attack, you weave around/under the Physical attack before attempting to launch yourself and your opponent skywards (2 seconds)
- Feint/Attack-Cancel - Fake an attack/cancel an attack mid-way through swinging at the cost of Posture (1 second)
- Block - Guarding against any and all damage geared towards them in exchange for Posture damage (1~ second)
- Parry - Attempt to deflect an attack with high risks for a large reward (2 seconds with 1 second cooldown on failed parry, can parry 7 attacks in 1 second)
- Dodge - Move up to the maximum Move distance to dodge out of most attacks with invincibility/damage reduction (2 seconds with 4 second cooldown)
- Dodge-Feint - Feign a large-moving dodge to side-step 5ft in a direction of choice (1 Second; performable only twice in 4 Round)
- Vent - Use 40 Tempo to gain invulnerability for 2 seconds and blow away every creature within 5ft, 20ft away without damage; is blockable to negate knockback (2 seconds with 1 second end-lag)
- Wait - Spend 1 Second doing nothing (1 second)
- Cast Mantra - Perform a specialised action using Ether to assault your enemy(ies) (Varies; usually 1 second start-up)
- Feint Mantra* - Cancel the usage of a Mantra and its Ether consumption to bait an attack in or switch up attacks. (Note: Only certain Attunements can allow you to perform this sort of Action) (1 second)
- Quick-Equip Item/Equipment - Swap out a held item or bring out a held item from the Player's inventory (2-4 seconds)
- Throw Item/Weapon - Take any held item in-hand and lob it at at a Target within range.
- Use Item/add/switch Equipment - Depending on the item in-hand, use it for its intended effect/switch pieces of equipment (1 Second)
- Action Break - Once per-round, a Player can spend an Action Break to change their queued actions after seeing each Action happen during Combat; even if interrupted, they can start new Actions instead based on how much time is left during the Round. (Instant)
- Creative Action - Once per-round, depending upon the complexity of a desired Creative Action, a Player can request the DM the ability to perform a set of actions in a sequence that can be performed between 1-4 seconds out of the available Actions mentioned up above, enabling to perform more complex manoeuvres which can yield surprising results if you have an idea and want to act upon it. Note that Creative Actions won't allow you to perform Quick Attacks more often than the allotted combat-speed will allow for each weapon, but can offer ways to surpass difficult enemies and their abilities or protective capabilities.

# Combat Explained
## Combat Part 1: Round 1: Battle-Start
All Players and NPCs acting as participants will start off combat simultaneously unless the following is acted upon:
- Ambush takes the player/NPC by surprise
- Aware of an Ambush and pre-planning a course of action against the Ambush
- NPCs are given the highest Initiative for their 1st/Scripted Actions before giving them a normal Initiative
- Players are given advanced Initiatives for certain criteria
- Certain Talents affect the way combat is played
All Actions in a Round are performed in 4 seconds amongst all participants, with spacing being determined as 5ft = 1 Square. In a fair fight/duel, the distance between a player and their opponent is 10ft, but in randomised combat, distance can vary greatly depending on intentions, actions, and desires. In those 4 seconds, a player's Actions Economy to use Actions in that time is split up in the duration of what they can do in those 4 Seconds. Each Action has their own Speed, Duration, and Cost to use, so it should be expected certain Actions and Mantras to be faster than others.

Movement can happen any time during Combat, including splitting 
Moves between Attacks if both creatures are moving while attacking, but hit creatures lose all ability to move to new spaces, but does not disable their ability to evade/guard attacks.

Rounds only move on to the next once all available Actions have been chosen and taken.

There are 3 types of Combat-States: Assault, Attack, and Defence. On Round 1, all participants are in Assault Mode unless specified otherwise.
### Combat State: Assault Mode
All creatures in Assault Mode act Simultaneously to one and another and perform competing Actions in order to shift themselves into Attack Mode; their 1st Action will compete against each other for speed with those landing their hit first enabling them to act in Attack Mode on the next Round whilst putting their opponent into Defence Mode and continue fighting with their advantage. Those in Assault Mode can Attack or Defend semi-freely.
The Player who lands their 1st Attack upon another Creature in Assault Mode will immediately cease any Actions they had Queued up for their Turn during that Round. This also locks that Player and those hit by their Attack(s) into Attack and Defence Modes respectively. Those who weren't hit remain in Assault Mode until they've been hit/land a hit.

## Combat Part 2: Round 2+: Battle-Onwards.
From Round 2 onwards, if any creature is in Assault Mode, they'll act first and simultaneously at any target of their choosing; if a creature/multiple creatures are in Attack Mode, each must roll a dice with the higher number of the group dictating the initiative-order of each group who Attacks  and Defends first, whilst also making the ones at the top of that Initiative Order attack simultaneously with those in Assault Mode.

### Combat State: Attack Mode
Creatures in Assault Mode have active advantage fighting other creatures, being fully capable of attacking enemies to their heart's content whilst also maintaining the ability to Dodge, Block, Parry, Vent, and use Items.
If you're hit by an Attack or some other Action during your Attack Mode, you're automatically placed into Defence Mode, and whatever Seconds you have left in your Turn, with the next Second available being impossible for the player to Block, Dodge, use Items, Attack, or Cast Mantras, are turned into your Defence Mode Actions that you can designate in the heat of the moment before the end of your Turn.
If a Defence Mode creature successfully lands a Vent against you, you're both placed back into Assault Mode.
### Combat State: Defence Mode
Creatures in Defence Mode have a disadvantage in combat, usually placed in this state after taking a hit; during the 1st actable Second after being placed into Defence Mode, the creature can't Attack, Block, Dodge, use Items, or cast Mantras due to hit-stun, but every Second that comes after, the creature can Block and Dodge upcoming attacks that threaten them.
If a Creature in Defence Mode lands a Parry against their opponent's Attack, both parties switch Modes i.e. Defence to Attack and Attack to Defence, and thus the Creature in Attack Mode can now do actions only permittable in Attack Mode.
If you're able to successfully land a Vent against a creature in Attack Mode, you and all creatures within the radius of the Vent are pushed back and placed back into Assault Mode.

Combat will continue to go on like this until one side is all Knocked, Dead, Carried, all but 1 side have managed to successfully flee Combat, or a mixture of the 4.

# Combat Summarised
In combat, everyone starts in Assault Mode. Rounds last 4 Seconds each Round.
Each Action a player spends during their turn last a certain amount of seconds- either pulling off or how long until they land the attack, and each Action is queued one after another kinda like Final Fantasy 13. During Combat after queueing your Action(s), you can choose to perform an Action Break to stop your Queued Actions to setup a new set of Actions.
When a Player runs out of HP, they're Downed not Dead, and to kill a Downed person, they either have to spend 2 continuous Rounds being Gripped by another creature, or spend 3 continuous Rounds drowning in water.
