Set in the world of Helluva Boss and Hazbin Hotel, the players are either existing denizens of hell, or humans reborn in hell as unique forms of their own soul that depict them as a being they both view themselves and who the truly are as people.

# Race choices
Undead are highly uncommon in the space of Hell as the violent rampant nature of beings within Hell, and the overwhelming number of imps both big and small, amongst other species, render them unnecessary or of too great a threat except by beings of greater power. Humans are impossible to find in Hell, aside from the souls of Damned Humans given a new form. Human sinners sent to Hell, or certain powerful beings born within Hell are labelled as Demons, usually taking on unique appearances unlike the other denizens of Hell. When someone from Hell escapes the realm of Hell and to the Mortal Realm, they are partially considered to be Outsiders, but if they die outside of their Realm, they do not get sent back to the Realm they originate from, and die immediately. A large disparity between the Denizens of Hell, and Demons born from the souls of Sinners, Sinners aren't capable of dying permanently unless slain with Angelic weaponry/weapons infused with Holy material, with normal Demons born in Hell still being able to die from normal weapons unless they're born/grow to become particularly powerful.
