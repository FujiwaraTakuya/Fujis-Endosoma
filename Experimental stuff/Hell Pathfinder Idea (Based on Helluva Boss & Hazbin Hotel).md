Set in the world of Helluva Boss and Hazbin Hotel, the players are either existing denizens of hell, or humans reborn in hell as unique forms of their own soul that depict them as a being they both view themselves and who the truly are as people.

# Race choices
Undead are highly uncommon in the space of Hell as the violent rampant nature of beings within Hell, and the overwhelming number of imps both big and small, amongst other species, render them unnecessary or of too great a threat except by beings of greater power. Humans are impossible to find in Hell, aside from the souls of Damned Humans given a new form. Human sinners sent to Hell, or certain powerful beings born within Hell are labelled as Demons, usually taking on unique appearances unlike the other denizens of Hell. When someone from Hell escapes the realm of Hell and to the Mortal Realm, they are partially considered to be Outsiders, but do not gain the racial benefits of one, and if they die outside of their Realm, they do not get sent back to the Realm they originate from, and die immediately. A large disparity between the Denizens of Hell, and Demons born from the souls of Sinners, Sinners aren't capable of dying permanently unless slain with Angelic weaponry/weapons infused with Holy material, with normal Demons born in Hell still being able to die from normal weapons unless they're born/grow to become particularly powerful.

Here is a list of races that players can choose from that were born in Hell if players want to exist as a Hellspawn:
## Imps
Size: Small/Medium
Speed: 20ft Small/30ft Medium
Ability Score Modifier: -1 Str, +2 Dex, +1 Con, -2 Wis, -2 Int, +1 Cha

- Sneaky: Members of this race gain a +4 [racial bonus](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Racial-Bonus) on [Stealth](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/stealth) checks.
- Fleet-Footed: The race has at least a +2 [racial bonus](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Racial-Bonus) to [Dexterity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-). Members of this race receive [Run](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/run) as a bonus feat and a +2 [racial bonus](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Racial-Bonus) on [initiative](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Initiative) checks.
- Fast: Members of this race gain a +10 foot bonus to their base speed. This trait can be taken more than once, but each time it is, the cost increases by 1 RP. Its effects stack.
- Climb: Members of this race have a climb speed of 20 feet, and gain the +8 [racial bonus](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Racial-Bonus) on [Climb](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/climb) checks that a climb speed normally grants.
- Expert Climber: Must have the [Climb](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/climb) racial trait. Members of this race can cling to cave walls and even ceilings as long as the surface has hand- and footholds. In effect, members of this race are treated as being constantly under the effects of a non-magical [spider climb](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/spider-climb) spell, save that members of this race cannot cling to smooth surfaces. This trait doubles the normal +8 [racial bonus](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Racial-Bonus) on [Climb](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/climb) checks normally granted to creatures with a climb speed (to a total +16 bonus).
- Bite: Members of this race gain a natural bite attack, dealing damage equivalent to that of a creature two size categories lower than normal for their size (1d2 for Small races, 1d3 for Medium, etc.). The bite is a primary attack, or a secondary attack if the creature is wielding manufactured weapons. This trait can be taken up to two times. The second time it is taken, the bite damage increases by one size category.
- Hatred (Player Choice): Choose two subtypes of [humanoids](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid) or [outsiders](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Outsider) or one creature type other than [humanoid](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid) or [outsider](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Outsider). Members of this race gain a +1 [racial bonus](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Racial-Bonus) on [attack rolls](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll) against creatures of these subtypes or this type.
- Slapping Tail: Members of this race have a tail they can use to make [attacks of opportunity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity) with a reach of 5 feet. The tail is a [natural attack](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Natural-Attacks) that deals 1d6 points of damage plus the user’s [Strength](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-) modifier if Small, 1d8 points of damage plus the user’s [Strength](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-) modifier if Medium, or 1d10 points of damage plus 1-1/2 times the user’s [Strength](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-) modifier if Large. If a Large creature has the reach trait, its tail also gains reach.
- Swarming: Members of this race are used to living and fighting communally with other members of their race. Up to two members of this race can share the same square at the same time. If two members of this race that are occupying the same square attack the same foe, they are considered to be [flanking](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Flanking) that foe as if they were in two opposite squares. If the race is Small or smaller, this trait costs 1 RP. If the race is Medium, it costs 2 RP.
- Weapon Familiarity (Daggers, Pistols): Choose up to two weapons, or one weapon and a racial weapon group. When choosing a racial weapon group, you must choose a group that includes the same name as one of your subtypes. Members of this race are proficient with those weapons. For the purposes of weapon familiarity, all bows are considered one weapon. This trait can be taken up to two times. The second time it is taken, the race becomes proficient with another two weapons or one weapon and a racial weapon group.
- Natural Attack: Pick one of the following [natural attacks](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Natural-Attacks): gore, hoof (if the race has hooves), slam, talons, or wings (if the race has flight). Members of this race receive one [natural attack](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Natural-Attacks) of the chosen type. Gore, slam, and talons are primary [natural attacks](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Natural-Attacks), while hoof and wings are secondary [natural attacks](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Natural-Attacks). The damage is based on the creature’s size. This trait can be taken multiple times. Each time, pick a different [natural attack](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Natural-Attacks).
- Tripping Tail: Must have the Slapping Tail Trait. When a member of this race hits with its slapping tail, it can make a [trip](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Trip) attack as a [free action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions) that does not provoke [attacks of opportunity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity)
- Prehensile Tail: Members of this race have a long, flexible tail that can be used to carry objects. They cannot wield weapons with their tails, but they can retrieve small, stowed objects carried on their persons as a [swift action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions).
