Set in the world of Helluva Boss and Hazbin Hotel, the players are either existing denizens of hell, or humans reborn in hell as unique forms of their own soul that depict them as a being they both view themselves and who the truly are as people.

# Race choices
Undead are highly uncommon in the space of Hell as the violent rampant nature of beings within Hell, and the overwhelming number of imps both big and small, amongst other species, render them unnecessary or of too great a threat except by beings of greater power.

Humans are impossible to find in Hell, aside from the souls of Damned Humans given a new form. Human sinners sent to Hell, or certain powerful beings born within Hell are labelled as Demons, usually taking on unique appearances unlike the other denizens of Hell.

When someone from Hell escapes the realm of Hell and to the Mortal Realm, they are partially considered to be Outsiders, but do not gain the racial benefits of one, and if they die outside of their Realm, they do not get sent back to the Realm they originate from, and die immediately. A large disparity between the Denizens of Hell, and Demons born from the souls of Sinners, Sinners aren't capable of dying permanently unless slain with Angelic weaponry/weapons infused with Holy material, with normal Demons born in Hell still being able to die from normal weapons unless they're born/grow to become particularly powerful. Demons are the only Outsiders who bypass this rule if they are 'killed' outside of Hell. When a Demon dies in the mortal realm, their body is left behind to disintegrate into ashes that are easily enough to be blown away by the wind, as the soul is reformed back in Hell in a weakened state.

Denizens of Hell can die and be revived akin to mortals, but specific requirements must be met in order to allow the Denizen to be revived:
- Must have at least their head and torso mostly intact (bisected, missing chunks, etc. is applicable; roughly around 50% remaining of the head and 30% of their torso)
- Dead beings essentially enter of stasis in Hell unless there is not enough of their body to revive them with, whilst dead beings outside of Hell must have their bodies returned to Hell in order to be revived
- When a body is revived, the being's body will become stabilized, any minor wounds will be healed, and the being will be revived as though no obvious time-period had passed since the moment they died and when they wake up. Weaker resurrective abilities do not heal larger wounds, with stronger abilities sealing the larger wounds but also increasing the difficulty of reconnecting and healing reattached limbs 
- Limbs cut or torn cleanly can't be reformed or reattached without hospital attention
- Hospitals can offer temporary prosthetics to help with recovery if limb recovery is impossible, but a permanent replacement is required eventually as part of the service to attach said prosthetic, or the prosthetic is taken away and no further service is supplied
- Demons who die in Hell from non-Holy weapons/weapons infused with Holy materials revive themselves in 1d6 Rounds up to 25% of their HP after taking fatal damage, gaining the Fatigued Condition; dying again and reviving in this manner places them in the Exhausted Condition; dying any more times after this causes one of their Core Stats to suffer Energy Drain rolled with a d6, and this Energy Drain can be healed the same way from the effects of poisons and spells. If at any point the body is attacked with a Holy weapon, the revival becomes impossible and the soul of the Demon is completely obliterated, leaving only the body
