# Evolution Dissection
Evolution is normally slow and gradual for most creatures/monsters in this world; it's something accessible to all, aside from humans, but those with a strong enough will and power to traverse the harsh reality that is survival, creatures/monsters can become powerful entities that can rival demigods if left unchecked. It's possible for those born as a creature/monster used to be a humanoid of some kind in their prior life, given another opportunity to survive in this reality as they can gain abilities unseen before from others of their new kin. As for what those creatures or monsters choose to do to live their life after the fact, that's up for them to decide.

Evolutions with this system can be split up into descriptive phases as to how each 'Evolution' functions for its species.

In Phase 1, species start out as a basic creature or monster species that is usually considered small and lesser to others of their kin; Players, for the sake of balance, start out as the weakest species within the Evolution-line unless starting elsewhere in the evolution. They gain no particular benefits to their racial qualities than what's normally offered to their species, however if born from a species of a higher evolution they can be given additional racial qualities normally attained through evolutions.

In Phase 2, Creatures/Monsters choose to either become a Small or Lesser of their species, choosing to either remain small with more unique benefits, or forgo their size to attain a larger body more applicable for physical confrontations with larger creatures.

In Phase 3 the species begin to evolve either into an adult of the species or another divergent path that usually gives the creature a particular element available to them a magical focus in their abilities.

In Phase 4, creatures/monsters will gain the ability to evolve either to a larger, more physically dangerous variant of the species, or a rarer species unlike most of the kin that can give them unique characteristics. Most creatures without the will or ability to survive will tend to find themselves reaching the end of their evolutions here, or at Phase 5 where most creatures will no longer evolve.

In Phase 5, you'll usually find most of the late-evolution species to either be unable to evolve later due to an active deterrent preventing them from becoming any larger, or a lack of ability to evolve any further. Those within this stage are usually pretty large beasts for their species, and for the rare few, can evolve to something even more terrifying than before- a titan amongst their kin, and a terrifying beast to behold. 

Phase 6, or a final evolution recorded by most documents of the species; a threat to towns or even entire cities, the power of a Phase 6 creature/monster should not be underestimated even for their small or huge size. For most, this is the pinnacle of power their species can achieve, but only few if any are able to learn of what lies beyond the 6th evolution of any species, if one were able to evolve beyond this fact.
## Simplified Evolutionary Chart
- Phase 1 - Small Lesser Creature/Monster (Birth of a creature)
- Phase 2 - Small/Lesser Creature/Monster Split (Physical or Mechanical dominance)
- Phase 3 - Evolutionary Split (Species divergence with focus into physical or mind stats)
- Phase 4 - 'Class' development (Greater evolution of split-evolution)
- Phase 5 - Secondary Evolutionary Split (Evolution into the final stages of one's possible capabilities or something greater)
- Phase 6 - Unknown Territory (Evolving even further that what's known or recorded unbeknownst to those beyond within the mortal coil or those incapable to live long enough to speak or record such knowledge)
## Evolution Levels
- Phase 1 (1-2 Levels)
- Phase 2 (1-4 Levels)
- Phase 3 (1-5 Levels)
- Phase 4 (1-4 Levels)
- Phase 5 (1-3 Levels)
- Phase 6 (1-2 Levels)
