## Stats
For the Average Human Hunter, their Stats all start at 11- however depending upon the build and the Character of the Hunter, these stats can move about to depict their differences to their normal Human counterpart who have a base-Stat of 1-3. Each Stat follows its own independent ranking system to the Mana Power-Ranking, but follow the similar system of the Alphabetical E-S Rankings. If your Stats can reach a Level higher than E, you can perform greater feats of ability in front of those of equal or lower rank- all dependant on your personal Rank and Targets of choice (I.e. write about how higher ranks can attack lower ranks more often due to speed and power).
### Strength
Your Physical Strength; your ability to dish out power through outward and inward force, as well as your physical ability to perform strength-based feats.
### Vitality
Your Physical Durability; your ability to take damage and resist conditions being forced upon you, as well as determining your HP pool, Stamina, your HP and MP Recovery, and your Fatigue-Gauge.
### Dexterity
Your Physical Flexibility and Control; your ability to concentrate and accurately manoeuvre your body, control your limbs to perform careful and precise actions with ease, and the ability to act quicker in a shorter amount of time.
### Intelligence
Your Magical ability and capacity; your ability to cast magic within your area of control and using it to attack, defend, heal, buff, or debuff targets within range and selection, as well as your ability to raise your limits on how much you can cast within a day.
### Perception
Your Visual and Instinctual Prowess; usually combined with Intelligence, Strength, or Dexterity, this enables the user to track and keep track of presences around them without needing line of sight, while also alerting them to danger coming towards them and ways to avoid the danger, and with high enough perception can help the user perceive weaknesses easier and in some cases land then easier against their targets.
### Stat Rankings
E-Rank: (Power above a normal Average Human, but nothing too impressive or special)
D-Rank: (Notable difference in ability that can be considered superhuman by current scientific standards)
C-Rank: (The Average middle-ground of Noted Hunter competence, the level of skill and capability is usually only seen in realms of fantasy media with the Average Skilled Mercenary)
B-Rank: (Usually some of the no-nonsense types, these Hunters are of a higher, more professional skill than the Average Hunters; decked out in traditional fantasy-style gear with experience and skill, B-Rankers are powerful in their own right and in some cases can solo D or E-Rank Dungeons if it weren't for the legal and money-reasons; healers of this rank are capable of healing severed limbs back to the body and closing wounds to even organs, but cannot restore lost blood to one's system if blood loss is too great)
A-Rank: (The second-highest ) 
S-Rank: Usually unrankable due to the currently availability of A-Rank or higher Mana Stones that can be used to Rank those higher than A, their powers statistically rival only each other as S-Rankers while A-Rankers may only be able to reach one of their stats close enough to that of an S-Ranker, with the rest of their stats lacking behind in comparison; S-rankers are usually training constantly for A-Rank or higher jobs to protect civilization more easily when the time calls for it, but they can be called in times of emergencies such as Red Gates or Dungeon Breaks)
