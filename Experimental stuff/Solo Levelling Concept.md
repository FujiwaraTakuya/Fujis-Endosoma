# Base Sytems Explanation
## Human Mana Power-Ranking System (Rough 'measurements' (Lorebuilding)
- >5 - Average Human (Level 0)
- 10 - 140 - E-Ranker (Level 1-5)
- 141-700 - D Ranker (Level 6-15)
- 701-2,100 - C Ranker (level 16-35)
- 2,101-8,400 - B Ranker (Level 36-75)
- 8,401-42,000 - A Ranker (level 76-155)
- 42,001-252,000+ - S Ranker (Level 156-310+)
## Stats
For the Average Human E-Rank Hunter, their Stats all start at 11- however depending upon the build and the Character of the Hunter, these stats can move about to depict their differences to their normal Human counterpart who have a base-Stat of 1-3. Each Stat follows its own independent ranking system to the Mana Power-Ranking, but follow the similar system of the Alphabetical E-S Rankings. If your Stats can reach a Level higher than E, you can perform greater feats of ability in front of those of equal or lower rank- all dependant on your personal Rank and Targets of choice (I.e. write about how higher ranks can attack lower ranks more often due to speed and power).
### Strength
Your Physical Strength; your ability to dish out power through outward and inward force, as well as your physical ability to perform strength-based feats.
### Vitality
Your Physical Durability; your ability to take damage and resist conditions being forced upon you, as well as determining your HP pool, Stamina, your HP and MP Recovery, and your Fatigue-Gauge.
### Dexterity
Your Physical Flexibility and Control; your ability to concentrate and accurately manoeuvre your body, control your limbs to perform careful and precise actions with ease, and the ability to act quicker in a shorter amount of time.
### Intelligence
Your Magical ability and capacity; your ability to cast magic within your area of control and using it to attack, defend, heal, buff, or debuff targets within range and selection, as well as your ability to raise your limits on how much you can cast within a day.
### Perception
Your Visual and Instinctual Prowess; usually combined with Intelligence, Strength, or Dexterity, this enables the user to track and keep track of presences around them without needing line of sight, while also alerting them to danger coming towards them and ways to avoid the danger, and with high enough perception can help the user perceive weaknesses easier and in some cases land then easier against their targets.
### Stat Rankings
**E-Rank:** 5-15 Points, equal to power of 2-4 humans *(Power above a normal Average Human, but nothing too impressive or special)*
**D-Rank:** 16-35 Points, equal to power of 4-8 humans *(Notable difference in ability that can be considered superhuman by current scientific standards)*
**C-Rank:** 36-60 Points, equal to power of 8-16 humans *(The Average middle-ground of Noted Hunter competence, the level of skill and capability is usually only seen in realms of fantasy media with the Average Skilled Mercenary)*
**B-Rank:** 61-95 Points, equal to power of 16-32 humans *(Usually some of the no-nonsense types, these Hunters are of a higher, more professional skill than the Average Hunters; decked out in traditional fantasy-style gear with experience and skill, B-Rankers are powerful in their own right and in some cases can solo D or E-Rank Dungeons if it weren't for the legal and money-reasons; healers of this rank are capable of healing severed limbs back to the body and closing wounds to even organs, but cannot restore lost blood to one's system if blood loss is too great)*
**A-Rank:** 96-135 Points, equal to power of 32-64 humans *(The second-highest rank, and some of the most relied-upon Hunters for dangerous tasks in the country, A-Rank Hunters will usually almost be instantly head-hunted by Guilds the moment they leave the Awakening Ranking Interview. Powerful in their own rights, A-Rankers are technically capable of leading entire squadrons of Hunters into Gates on their own if they had the ability to, but due to an overwhelming lack of skill in other areas and other factors, they still require a group of allies to cover for their weaknesses, but this shouldn't downplay their abilities to fight and fend for themselves or others)*
**S-Rank:** 136-200+ Points, equal to power of 65+ humans *(Usually unrankable due to the currently availability of A-Rank or higher Mana Stones that can be used to Rank those higher than A, their powers statistically rival only each other as S-Rankers while A-Rankers may only be able to reach one of their stats close enough to that of an S-Ranker, with the rest of their stats lacking behind in comparison; S-rankers are usually training constantly for A-Rank or higher jobs to protect civilization more easily when the time calls for it, but they can be called in times of emergencies such as Red Gates or Dungeon Breaks; because of their potential power being unmeasurable, not even small to Medium Countries would be enough to prevent an S-Ranking Hunter to go on an unrestrained rampage without serious damages everywhere they walk)*
#### Estimated Ranking
As a Player, due to your growing strength, instead of constantly Re-Evaluating Rankings, Players can estimate their Rank by counting the numbers of all of their Stats and finding the Mean of the total result, i.e. the Total Number Divided by the Value/Number of Stats **(E.g., A Hunter with a STR of 90 and everything else with a Stat of 10, the total becomes 130 (90+10+10+10+10), then you divide the result by 5 (STR, DEX, VIT, INT, PER; each counts as 1 Value), giving you a result of (130/5=) 26, meaning that the user despite having a high Strength is at a D-Ranking for their lack of ability in other aspects.)**

Estimating one's Ranking is important as it determines the Power-Value at which some Skills and Abilities are rolled with if they use a different Dice or Value when measuring the effectiveness of a Skill/Ability, such as Initiative rolling a different Dice for your Estimated Ranking. 
# Combat
## Combat
Combat follows the following phases for determining combat phases and actions:
- Roll Initiative (d4/d6/d8/d10/d12/d20 + Half of Dexterity & Perception)
- Round Start - Start-of-Round Conditions
- Phase 1 - Readying Actions & Setting Actions
- Phase 2 - Engaging Actions
- Phase 2.1 - Reacting Actions
- Phase 2.2 - Reacting Conditions
- Phase 3 - End-of-Round Conditions
- Round End, then Next Round.
### Performable Actions
Here's a list of Actions a player can choose during Phase 1 and 3:
#### Phase 1 Actions
- Attack - Attempt to deal Physical Damage
- Counter - Attempting to predict, nullify, and deal extra damage with a Physical Damage attack by attacking back while risking taking extra damage
- Guard - Having the full intention to protect one's self from harm, and in some case become a wall that protects allies from damage
	- Guard & Riposte - An attempt to guarantee one's safety in dealing harm to an enemy by blocking an attack first before quickly rebutting with a strike of their own, although only really effective in melee 
- Deflect - Either by grabbing or attacking, the user attempts to nullify any damage taken from non-contact-explosive projectiles by hitting through or stopping the incoming attack(s) 
- Grab - With a free hand or a Weapon with the Grapple Property, the user holds onto the limb or feature of a creature and attempts to maintain a fixed position upon the creature, stopping another creature's movements away from the user if equal-sized or smaller, or placing a user dangling upon the creature like they're climbing if at least 1 size larger
	- Disarm
	- Grapple
	- Rend
	- Trip
- Aim
	- Aim and Train Shot
- Channel Spell

### Initiative
When any combat starts, all creatures must roll Initiative to determine who can act first, and
