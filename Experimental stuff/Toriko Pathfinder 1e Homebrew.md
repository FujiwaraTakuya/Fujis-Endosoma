# Prologue
Someone once said there are beasts whose entire body is marbled meat that melts in your mouth. There are springs from which gush forth refreshing beverages made from deep, rich juices of the highest quality muskmelons and perfectly ripened mangoes in which endlessly dance bubbles of sweetness. The world is in the Gourmet Age. An age in which people quest for yet unknown culinary delights!
## Classes
There are a couple classes unique to the world of Toriko 
- Gourmet Chef - A dedicated chef whom their main objective in life is to cook food unique to them and their life choices; their are many normal methods achievable, but some have almost superhuman abilities that are unique to them that enable them to perform feats of strange cooking and combat techniques that would not be normally possible by the average human, including expelling cooking oil from your skin to repel water fluids or fry your enemies, using threads to bind or slice through whatever's in front of you, throwing skewers to pin, penetrate, or target an enemy's nerves to halt certain bodily functions, carving through some of the toughest materials or even cutting only specified targets without hitting anything outside the targeted area, and so much more.
  
  Class Skills - Appraise, Craft (Cooking Implements, Cooking Utensils, Chefs Knives), Diplomacy, Handle Animal, Knowledge (Dungeoneering, Engineering, Geography, Local, Nature, Planes, Religion), Perception, Profession (Baker, Barrister, Brewer, Butcher, Cook, Gardener, Herbalist, Innkeeper, Merchant, Tanner), Sense Motive, Survival
- Bishokuya (Bih-Show-Koo-Yuh) (Gourmet Hunter) - Food Hunters who explore the world, gathering ingredients to sell and make their living; while normal amongst most of the populace, their strength is usually above human for most who battle to find new flavours amongst themselves, or trying to attain rare ingredients that come every couple or hundred of years for money or purpose. But there are those who're either born immensely strong, or are born with or given Gourmet Cells which enhance their physical abilities, while providing them a arsenal of powers utensil-based powers unique to their evolving Cells, along with a Demon that now resides and grows within them.
  
  Class Skills - Acrobatics, Bluff, Climb, Escape Artist, Intimidate, Knowledge (Dungeoneering, Engineering, Geography, History, Local, Nature, Planes, Religion), Perception, Profession (Butcher, Clerk, Driver, Engineer, Farmer, Fisherman, Gambler, Gardener, Innkeeper, Merchant, Miner, Porter, Sailor, Shepherd, Soldier, Tanner, Trapper, Woodcutter), Sense Motive, Sleight of Hand, Stealth, Survival, Swim
	- Appetite Demon - A being born of and made of Gourmet Cells; depending on their current life cycle, either exist in the world on their own or reborn as Cells within a Host's body, able to provide them power and knowledge should they accept it while being the cause of constant hunger and food needs within their host. Usually of Chaotic Alignment.
	- Bishokukai (Bih-Show-Koo-Kai) (Gourmet Corp.) - Part of an evil organisation of Food Hunters, they will target any ingredient in the world to make themselves stronger and reach the pinnacle of all food in the universe: God. They'll lie, steal, kill- all for their objectives, and do it all to evolve further and further for their own goals, whether aligned with the boss' desires or their own, power means everything to those within the organisation- and appearances and tastes would stray further and further within the abhorrent than most would like or care to know of. Usually of Neutral or evil alignment.

While their methods can be quite drastic at times, they usually aim to capture any criminal alive if possible to bring them to justice, while punishing those who abuse towards the ingredients and monsters of the world.
- Gourmet Knight - The more reclusive warriors of the Gourmet Universe, their speciality aside from their fighting prowess comes from their ability function days, to weeks, to months, to years on end within solitude or without food, and drawing upon their techniques with greater efficiency than most other beings are capable of producing, at the cost of a usually frailer body and strict 'Gourmet Doctrine' that makes them entrust their body to nature while living on the minimal amount of food possible while fasting.

## Races
While there are not a tremendous amount of playable species in this world beyond the planet earth, the level of flexibility that can be attained from each race as to the way your character looks and functions is helped immensely due to the biological feats made within the world of Toriko:
- Humans - Basic, but easiest race to modify and reach heights of surprising and terrifying power within the Normal World. Sometimes can be born with Gourmet Cells without needing an injection or consuming the fabled Gourmet Jellyfish.
- Modified Humanoid - Either beings who've modified themselves or been modified to adjust to their home's unique habitat or those born from ancient civilizations within the Gourmet World, or maybe given modifications to their body that would enable them to take over the limbs of another Monster through a unique surgery. May or may not need Gourmet Cells to survive modifications
- Modified Monster - A Monster from the Normal World (With a Capture Level of 1-30), or a weak Monster from the Gourmet World (Usually from one of the Ancient Civilizations) whom was modified by humanity or some third party with greater intelligence and the ability to speak the human language.
- Nitro - An alien race of noodly-faced, mouth-splitting, avian-looking humanoids without wings whom came from an ancient space-traversing species that roam the universe finding planets to imbue Gourmet Life into with generally dubious experimented methods; with 2 variations of species, red and blue, there is a much more massive disparity between the two races than most would realise. Made and born from the evolution of single celled Gourmet Cells, their ability procreate is nothing but recreational and non-functional.
	- Red Nitro - The most common species of Nitro in the universe, but also the weaker subspecies of Nitro; most were enslaved by the Blue Nitro and had their vocal cords irreparably damaged or removed, leading to them only being able to speak through monstrous screeches. Their personalities would be considerably close to that of humans, weren't it not for their self-consideration of a higher status as a species.
	- Blue Nitro - The rarer, self-considered higher species of Nitro, these intelligent sub-species use their minds to figure out the workings of the Gourmet Universe while travelling the stars, but with usually less than charitable reasons. They are part of the cause of why Gourmet Cells have been spread throughout the universe, but beyond the desire to understand more of it, the reason to continue is yet to be understood.
- Appetite Demon - An alien entity also born from Gourmet Cells; a host body is given a direct injection and the cells overwhelm its host's body due to their body being in compatible with the cells evolution, thus leading to the cells consuming its host and depending upon the level of destruction dealt to the host's cells, they either become a malformed modified humanoid being with some new traits but no Gourmet Cells, or becoming an entirely new being called an Appetite Demon. Their existence becomes entirely their own, and the host is no longer able to return to their body as all but their soul are consumed and taken from them. Appetite Demons born this way the first time can exist without a body for as long as they want, but if they die, their soul still exists thanks to their Gourmet Cells, and as such can allow them to be reborn at a different time through the randomised generation of Gourmet Cells somewhere throughout the world or planet they're upon, essentially becoming a symbiotic parasite to their given host while providing them access to a growing portion of their strength and other unique abilities. The only way for an Appetite Demon to exist outside of its Host's body, outside consuming a large number of the Host's Kcals during their manifestation, is for the Host to have consumed every dish of Acacia's Full Course- only then will their body have reached a stage of enlightenment that would allow their Appetite Demon to be able to permanently manifest at the Host's will with no Kcal consumption. The Demon themselves still requires food to sustain themselves as a being made of Gourmet Cells.
- Off-worlder/Alien (Modified Creature Creator) - An unnamed alien species from another planet aside from Earth that may or may not have received a dosage of Gourmet Cells; they could come in different shapes and sizes, but their categories usually fit into an easy-to-identify chart which could denote their capabilities.
