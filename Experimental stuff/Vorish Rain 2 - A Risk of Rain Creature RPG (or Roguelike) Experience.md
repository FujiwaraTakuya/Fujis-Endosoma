*In these encounters, lucky creatures from the planet have lucked their way into devouring an unsuspecting/unlucky Invader to their planet of Petrichor V; depending where and when they are able to devour them is up to a GM's design, but these creatures now gifted with an experience they'd never want to let go of, must now balance sustaining their own lives and the new ones they carry to continue growing in power to satisfy their growing greed. Let's hope that the power has gone to their stomachs and hasn't gone just to their heads.*
