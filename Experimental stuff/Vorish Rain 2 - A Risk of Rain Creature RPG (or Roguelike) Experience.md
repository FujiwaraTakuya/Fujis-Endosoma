*In these encounters, lucky creatures from the planet have lucked their way into devouring an unsuspecting/unlucky Invader to their planet of Petrichor V; depending where and when they are able to devour them is up to a GM's design, but these creatures now gifted with an experience they'd never want to let go of, must now balance sustaining their own lives and the new ones they carry to continue growing in power to satisfy their growing greed. Let's hope that the power has gone to their stomachs and hasn't gone just to their heads.*

# Stats to keep track of
Monster Health - Starts at Monster HP; each Level Up increases Monster Base HP by static amount
Invader(s) HP - Always starts at chosen Invader's HP; each Level Up increases HP by +10, is the source of HP Regeneration for the Player-Monster, and must be up-kept with either items or healing effects in order for the Monster to benefit from Health Regeneration from them.
Monster Level & Experience - Basic System to show Player-Monster growth
Invader Level & Experience - Necessary metric to determine your Invader(s) later ability for survival within your guts- not that'll help them escape you in any way once inside
Size Category - Your size determines your effectiveness at hitting single or multiple targets with your attacks (Depending on the attack used), how hard or easy it is to hit you, and the dice you roll to determine your ability to evade damage from other Monsters/Invaders
Evolution - The evolutionary-state of your Monster should it have the ability to Evolve into a more powerful form
Stomach Capacity - Determined by your size, evolutionary state, and Level, determines how many occupants you can keep within yourself to benefit from health regeneration


# Difficulty "Setting"
For the sake of simplicity and speed, Damage rolls are mostly static, with Attack Rolls being rolled are made with one of the following Dice Systems with the following rules:
- General Difficulty Dice System (Consistent; might be too simple)
	- Very Easy/Drizzle (d2, fail on 1, success on 2)
	- Easy/Rainstorm (d3, fail on 1, success on 3, off-shot on 2)
	- Normal/Monsoon (d4, fail on 1, success on 4, off-shot on 2-3)
	- Hard/Eclipse (d6, fail on 1, success on 5-6, off-shot on 2-4)
- Size Difficulty Dice System (Larger creatures are easier to hit than smaller creatures)
	- Huge+/Drizzle (d10, fail on 1, success on 6-10, off-shot on 2-4)
	- Large/Rainstorm (d10, fail on 1-2, success on 7-10, off-shot on 3-6)
	- Medium/Monsoon (d10, fail on 1-3, success on 8-10, off-shot on 4-7)
	- Small/Eclipse (d10, fail on 1-4, success on 9-10, off-shot on 5-8)
