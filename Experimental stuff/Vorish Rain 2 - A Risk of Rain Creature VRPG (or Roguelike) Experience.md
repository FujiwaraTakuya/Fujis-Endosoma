*Something's changed. The powers that be that reside upon Petrichor V have changed itself once more; its beasts grow more intelligent, their tactics becoming less static, and some...well...their intentions are...less than pure. They seem to have grown ravenous- hungering- desiring more than just the urge to defeat the intruders that fall and teleport across their homes. Some are luck, most not so, but those that do survive these encounters gradually awaken to power unlike anything they've ever experienced before.*

*In these encounters, lucky creatures from the planet have lucked their way into devouring an unsuspecting/unlucky Invader to their planet of Petrichor V; depending where and when they are able to devour them is up to a GM's design, but these creatures now gifted with an experience they'd never want to let go of, must now balance sustaining their own lives and the new ones they carry to continue growing in power to satisfy their growing greed. Let's hope that the power has gone to their stomachs and hasn't gone just to their heads.*

*Death's no longer permanent to either side; the Invaders transfer their consciousness to new clones after each death and return from the sky; the Monsters return to non-existence to revive before being brought back to this reality to attack those who invade upon the realm; just what'll both sides do to exploit this fact?*

Starting out, Players have already eaten or are in the process of lucking themselves into eating an Invader; what happens afterwards is a constant spiral of threat and survival where they must protect themselves and their occupant and try to survive as long as possible, become part of an on-going story that they must journey themselves through to its end or their up and coming deaths.

Note: For those who don't do Digestion, alternate rulings can be made where instead of Digestion, it's Energy Drain with the occupant becoming Knocked Out instead, teleporting them back to their ship upon defeat.
# Campaign Style
When making this system, I had 4 styles of play in mind:
- Traditional Tabletop: In the style of a traditional Tabletop RPG with a story, there's plenty of avenue for encounters- simple or even creative, with a unique flare considering the ever-present threat of spawning monsters (Encounters are determined by the DM, with 'random encounters' being the equivalent to sudden spawns)
- Roleplay-centric: In a more free-form encounter, movement and performance is dictated more by roleplay-style descriptions with damage being depicted with the system (Combat is usually searched for, rather than being chased after by Monsters, giving greater freedom for player-interactions and character building)
- Roguelike: Played like the game, Encounters continue throughout the game gradually with waves of enemies that'll continuously, with 1-minute grace periods to find Monuments, Item Boxes, or Shrines of interest, with the main aim being trying to survive for as long as possible and becoming a powerhouse, or reach one of the many endings normally available in the game (ROR2 but if Tabletop, harder to keep track of, but plays more like a game than an experience)
- Story-Writing Base: Essentially a collection of numbers and details to give both people and players a greater idea of how Monsters, items, and special encounters work in this version of the universe, or closely to the original source material (Not really used as a 1-to-1 comparison for combat or world-interactions, but can be a helpful base for creating ideas for the universe)
# Stats to keep track of
**Monster HP** - Starts at Monster HP; each Level Up increases Monster Base HP by static amount
**Invader(s) HP** - Always starts at chosen Invader's HP; each Level Up increases HP by +10, is the source of HP Regeneration for the Player-Monster, and must be up-kept with either items or healing effects in order for the Monster to benefit from Health Regeneration from them.
**Monster Level & Experience** - Basic System to show Player-Monster growth; your basic
**Invader Level & Experience** - Necessary metric to determine your Invader(s) later ability for survival within your guts- not that'll help them escape you in any way once inside; their experience gain correlates from the gold-count you have left before each teleport
**Size Category** - Your size determines your effectiveness at hitting single or multiple targets with your attacks (Depending on the attack used), how hard or easy it is to hit you, and the dice you roll to determine your ability to evade damage from other Monsters/Invaders
**Evolution** - The evolutionary-state of your Monster should it have the ability to Evolve into a more powerful form
**Stomach Capacity** - Determined by your size, evolutionary state, and Level, determines how many occupants you can keep within yourself to benefit from health regeneration
Invader Digestion/Energy Drain Rate - Starts at 1 Damage per-round, increasing by +1 per level multiple of 10
## How to calculate "Base Damage" & "Total Damage"
When determining a creature's Base Damage for attacks and items, use the following: (Creature BD + 1 per level + 1/2/3/5 per weapon item) x Buffs
Total Damage gains additional benefits like this: (Creature BD + 1 per level + 1/2/3/5 per weapon item) x Buffs x Damage Bonuses x Crit
## Dissection of certain stats and mechanic functions (Mostly for GM's sake)
- Stats
	- Attack Speed - Increases the user's Attack Roll per-stack; each time a Stack-Bonus is reached, usually referenced as reaching multiples of an item-number, the user gains either an additional Offensive Action or converting that Offensive Action into a bigger Bonus for Attack Rolls. You can use any number of Offensive Actions during  your Turn, with the rest of the Actions becoming an additional Attack Bonus.
	- Movement Speed - Increases the user's Dodge Roll per-stack; each time a Stack-Bonus is reached, usually referenced as reaching multiples of an item-number, the user gains either a forgo other benefits for their Dodge bonus, a Sprint Speed Buff (+25% per stack), or a Search Bonus. You can't benefit from a Sprint Speed Buff and Search Bonus simultaneously.
		- Stack Bonus - When you have enough stacks of an item, you can get a Stack Bonus; depending on the Stat that gives the Bonus, it can give different benefits such as: Additional Offensive Actions, Sprint Speed Buff, or Search Bonus. Attack Speed gives an Offensive Stack Bonus while Movement Speed gives a Defensive Stack Bonus.
	- Sprint Speed - Sprinting Doubles your Movement Speed, also improving your Dodge Bonus by the same amount, but in exchange disables the user's ability to use all Skills and Offensive Actions unless the ability states the ability to do so; in exchange for 1 Offensive Action, the user can use the Tactical Retreat Manoeuvre to instantly start Sprinting to run away from combat.
	- Health Regeneration - At the start of each creature's Turn in a Round, they gain HP equal to the Base HP Regen; negated by Malachite (anti-heal Debuff), outside of combat the HP Regen is applied each second instead of every Turn (6 seconds) of combat, while in-combat they can only heal at the start of their Turn.
	- Critical Strikes - A chance to increase your total damage by double the output. Effects like Healing, Buffs, and Debuffs do not benefit from Crits.
- Conditions
	- Burn - Creatures suffering the Burn Condition are set on fire for 2 Turns, causing creatures to take a Unique DOT that does not stack upon itself.
	- Launched - Creatures affected by this Condition are lifted into the air 3m (10ft).
	- Stunned - For the duration of the Condition, the creature is unable to act at all unless they are immune to the Condition, stopping all movement from the creature while also making them unable to Attack or Dodge.
	- Malachite - The creature affected by this Debuff gains no benefits from Health Regen or HP Restoration effects.
- Status Buffs/Debuffs
	- Frenzy: Increases the affected creature's Dodge Bonus by +5 and +2 or a Dodge Bonus of +5 and +1 Offensive Action.
# Difficulty "Setting"
For the sake of simplicity and speed, Damage rolls are mostly static, with Attack Rolls and Dodge Rolls being rolled are made with one of the following Dice Systems with the following rules (Note: DC = Difficulty Class i.e. how difficult it is to meet or surpass; you can choose to combine multiple Dice Systems to improve Difficulty if you so wish to add more complexity):
- General Difficulty Dice System for Attack Rolls (Consistent; might be too simple; either remain a single difficulty, or up to DM's discretion for creativeness)
		- Very Easy/Drizzle (d20, DC 1 only way to fail)
		- Easy/Rainstorm (d20, DC 2)
		- Normal/Monsoon (d20, DC 3)
		- Hard/Eclipse (d20, DC 4)
- Size Difficulty Dice System (Larger creatures are easier to hit than smaller creatures; generally more consistent hit-numbers with greater risks for failure or off-targeting)
	- Huge+/Drizzle (d20, DC 1)
	- Large/Rainstorm (d20, DC 2)
	- Medium/Monsoon (d20, DC 4)
	- Small-/Eclipse (d20, DC 5)
- Speed Difficulty Dice System (Faster creatures are harder to hit than smaller creatures, but due to sizes being a thing, being 'Fast' has a smaller range of DC to compensate)
	- Sluggish (d20, No DC/No Improvement)
	- Very Slow (d20, DC 1)
	- Slow (d20, DC 3)
	- Normal (d20, DC 4)
	- Fast (d20, DC 5)
	- Very Fast (d20,  DC 6)
	- Subsonic (d20, DC 7)
## Dodging
Dodging is unique in this game with its double-dice system; the first roll is to determine the overall success or failure of the Dodger's capabilities, with a second d100 roll is made to determine how many attacks they are capable of evading. Players and Invaders both have the ability to Dodge Offensive Actions, while none of the Mobs can. The second dice is always a d100 unless the number of attacking enemies or attacks exceed 100, which instead would make it a d1000.
# Playable (generally applicable) Monster Races

# Out-of-Combat Exploration
When not in combat, Players must pay close attention to their surroundings to find Boxes, Interactables, or Shrines to benefit their assault into each area that they want to steal items from; with the way Campaigns have different settings, the following rulesets can be chosen to more-fit the style of exploration and item-curation the DM wants:
- Item Spawns
	- Traditional Tabletop: To limit Player Progression to a more steady state, and convert the system to a more RPG-like tone, Hordes of enemies or smaller groups of powerful enemies need to be pre-designed for the Campaign ahead of time it's recommended that a minimum of 3-5 items per player be available for collection and addition to a Player's growing arsenal- obviously, randomly rolled with its rarity, but shareable amongst the players in case players have stuff others want and vice versa.
	- Roleplay-centric: Assuming that these groups are 2+ (Between a DM and a player, or more depending on roleplay group-size), short stories are recommended when setting up these encounters; items may or may not matter in the grand scheme of things in a Roleplay-centric setting, but using metrics with the system helps give interactions depth, but being a Roleplay-type setting some rooms for creativity can be made to make items perform a little outside of their intended usages. Either following the Traditional Ruleset, Roguelike Ruleset, or your own Custom Ruleset, I had a bit of a hard time trying to come up with a way to give Roleplay Rulesets their own item/event-rolling.
	- Roguelike: The DM rolls ((1 x Number of Teleport Loops Performed)d12 + (1 per Stage Teleported to, not including Hidden Realms)) to determine the number of available Boxes available in the Map; ((1 x Number of Teleport Loops Performed)d8 + (1 + 1 per Teleport Loops Performed)) to determine the number of available Shrines in the Map; ((1 x Number of Teleport Loops Performed)d4 + (1 + 1 per Teleport Loops Performed)) to determine the number of available Interactables available in the Map.
	- Story-Writing Base: Can choose to follow Roguelike's ruleset Roleplay-centric, or Tabletop- as the effects can differ minutely or greatly to the original content, it's up to the writer to decide on the facts presented to them to help with the story.
- Map Exploration
	- Traditional Tabletop: For random encounters, roll 2 d20s; the first is the type of encounter, and the second is the interactable itself:

# Combat Explained
Combat is split between 2 Actions that can be performed during a Player's turn: Offensive and Defensive Actions, and when the Player is attacked, they can choose to perform a Dodge to evade taking damage from an incoming or group of incoming Attack(s).

Players start all encounters with non-Boss Monsters first; Boss Fights however must be rolled with (d20 + Player Level) vs (d20 + (World Number x 5)) to determine an Initiative Order against a Boss; all non-Boss Monsters go after Players.

When a player chooses their Offensive and Defensive Action, Players can discuss who can act first with their Attacks, cycling through every player before passing on the Turn to the Monsters who collectively perform simple attacks if within range.

When preparing an attack, Players can choose one of the following Offensive Actions:
- Primary Skill - Use the Monster's Primary attacking Skill
- Secondary Skill - Use the Monster's Secondary Skill
- Invader Evasive Skill - Manipulate the Invader within you to use their Evasive Skill to your benefit
- Invader Utility Skill - Manipulate the Invader within you to use their Utility Skill to your benefit
- Activate Equipment - Activate your attached Equipment for its effect(s)
- Vore Action - Alternative to other Offensive Actions, used to consume 1 or more creatures for voracious benefits
- Tactical Retreat Manoeuvre - Pick your feet up and start making a break-neck dash away from all trouble coming your way, increasing your Dodge Bonus by the amount given from Sprinting, in exchange for ending your Turn early, forgoing Offensive Actions, and trying to escape combat.

When preparing your defence, Players can choose one of the following Defensive Actions:
- Balanced Stance - A balanced approach to combat, the Player gains no benefit or downside to fighting as such.
- Aggressive Stance - A heads-on approach to combat, the player improves their Attack Roll by 50% while lowering their Dodge Roll by 25%.
- Evasive Stance - A more elusive style of combat, the player raises their Dodge Roll by 50% while lowering their Attack Roll by 25%/
- Total Defence Stance - Unlike Evasive Defence, under the believed perception that they'll be taking damage from an attack no matter what, the user stands completely stationary and refuses to budge a single step, reducing any damage taken down by 50% while negating any knockback taken.

When all Players have finished performing their Attack Actions, all Monsters engage upon their own Attack Actions without performing a Defensive Action; during this, depending upon the Player's Stance, they can perform a Dodge Action to see how many attacks they can evade
# Vore Mechanic
As an alternative Offensive Action, Players can choose one of the following Vore Actions to perform (It should be clear that these are pred-centric options, but Players can):
- Devour - Depending upon your size, grab a number of creatures up to the designated limit and try to swallow them.
- Forceful Feeding - Depending upon your size, grab a number of creatures up to the designated limit and forcefully feed them to another nearby creature; unwilling preds take damage.
- Yeeting Feeding - Depending upon your size, grab a number of creatures up to the designated limit and throw them at a distant creature to forcefully feed them; unwilling preds take damage.
- Healing Devour - Attempt to devour a target to heal them instead of dealing damage to them, with the option to keep mouth open for reduced Dodge Bonus to keep allies benefitting from allied healing effects.
- Forceful Release - Akin to a Melee attack, the user strongly ejects 1 or multiple creatures out from inside them into an area around them, dealing damage at the same time.
- Yeeting Release - Akin to a Ranged Projectile attack, the user strongly ejects 1 or multiple creatures out from inside of them in a direction, dealing damage at the same time.
- Quick Release - Quickly release an ally, unit, or creature somewhere around you.
- Risky Devouring Guard (Friendly Fire) - Taking a risk attempting to devour a projectile attack and redirect it to everyone inside you; failing guarantees you taking the damage.
