*Something's changed. The powers that be that reside upon Petrichor V have changed itself once more; its beasts grow more intelligent, their tactics becoming less static, and some...well...their intentions are...less than pure. They seem to have grown ravenous- hungering- desiring more than just the urge to defeat the intruders that fall and teleport across their homes. Some are luck, most not so, but those that do survive these encounters gradually awaken to power unlike anything they've ever experienced before.*

*In these encounters, lucky creatures from the planet have lucked their way into devouring an unsuspecting/unlucky Invader to their planet of Petrichor V; depending where and when they are able to devour them is up to a GM's design, but these creatures now gifted with an experience they'd never want to let go of, must now balance sustaining their own lives and the new ones they carry to continue growing in power to satisfy their growing greed. Let's hope that the power has gone to their stomachs and hasn't gone just to their heads.*

*Death no longer permanent to either side; the Invaders transfer their consciousness to new clones after each death and return from the sky; the Monsters return to non-existence to revive before being brought back to this reality to attack those who invade upon the realm; just what'll both sides do to exploit this fact?*

Starting out, Players have already eaten or are in the process of lucking themselves into eating an Invader; what happens afterwards is a constant spiral of threat and survival where they must protect themselves and their occupant and try to survive as long as possible, become part of an on-going story that they must journey themselves through to its end or their deaths.

Note: For those who don't do Digestion, alternate rulings can be made where instead of Digestion, it's Energy Drain with the occupant becoming Knocked Out instead, teleporting them back to their ship upon defeat.
# Stats to keep track of
**Monster HP** - Starts at Monster HP; each Level Up increases Monster Base HP by static amount
**Invader(s) HP** - Always starts at chosen Invader's HP; each Level Up increases HP by +10, is the source of HP Regeneration for the Player-Monster, and must be up-kept with either items or healing effects in order for the Monster to benefit from Health Regeneration from them.
**Monster Level & Experience** - Basic System to show Player-Monster growth
**Invader Level & Experience** - Necessary metric to determine your Invader(s) later ability for survival within your guts- not that'll help them escape you in any way once inside
**Size Category** - Your size determines your effectiveness at hitting single or multiple targets with your attacks (Depending on the attack used), how hard or easy it is to hit you, and the dice you roll to determine your ability to evade damage from other Monsters/Invaders
**Evolution** - The evolutionary-state of your Monster should it have the ability to Evolve into a more powerful form
**Stomach Capacity** - Determined by your size, evolutionary state, and Level, determines how many occupants you can keep within yourself to benefit from health regeneration
Invader Digestion/Energy Drain Rate - Starts at 1 Damage per-round, increasing by +1 per level multiple of 10
## How to calculate "Base Damage"
Base Damage for all creatures is (1 + 1 per level + 1/2/3/5 per weapon item) x Damage Bonuses x Crit
# Difficulty "Setting"
For the sake of simplicity and speed, Damage rolls are mostly static, with Attack Rolls being rolled are made with one of the following Dice Systems with the following rules:

- General Difficulty Dice System (Consistent; might be too simple; An either remain a single difficulty, or up to DM's discretion for creativeness)
		- Very Easy/Drizzle (d2, fail on 1, success on 2)
		- Easy/Rainstorm (d3, fail on 1, success on 3, off-shot on 2)
		- Normal/Monsoon (d4, fail on 1, success on 4, off-shot on 2-3)
		- Hard/Eclipse (d6, fail on 1, success on 5-6, off-shot on 2-4)
- Size Difficulty Dice System (Larger creatures are easier to hit than smaller creatures; generally more consistent hit-numbers with greater risks for failure or off-targeting)
	- Huge+/Drizzle (d10, fail on 1, success on 6-10, off-shot on 2-5)
	- Large/Rainstorm (d10, fail on 1-2, success on 7-10, off-shot on 3-6)
	- Medium/Monsoon (d10, fail on 1-3, success on 7-10, off-shot on 4-6)
	- Small-/Eclipse (d10, fail on 1-3, success on 8-10, off-shot on 4-7)
## Dodging with Size
Dodging is unique with its double-dice system; the first roll is to determine the overall success or failure of the Dodger's capabilities, with a second d100 roll is made to determine how many attacks they are capable of evading. The second dice is always a d100 unless the number of attacking enemies or attacks exceed 100, which instead would make it a d1000, but the first dice roll can be chosen with one of the following below systems:
- General Difficulty Dice System (Consistent; might be too simple; Player/Invader-only ability, stays constant)
	- Very Easy/Drizzle (d6, fail on 1, success on 2-6)
	- Easy/Rainstorm (d6, fail on 1-2, success on 3-6)
	- Normal/Monsoon (d4, fail on 1-3, success on 4-6)
	- Hard/Eclipse (d6, fail on 1-3, success on 5-6, re-roll on 4)
- Size Difficulty Dice System (Larger creatures are easier to hit than smaller creatures; Player/Invader-only ability, DM discerns difficulty)
	- Huge+/Drizzle (d10, fail on 1-6, success on 7-10)
	- Large/Rainstorm (d10, fail on 1-4, success on 5-10)
	- Medium/Monsoon (d10, fail on 1-2, success on 3-10)
	- Small-/Eclipse (d10, fail on 1, success on 2-10)
# Playable (generally applicable) Monster Races

# Combat Explained
Combat is split between 2 Actions that can be performed during a Player's turn: Offensive and Defensive Actions, and when the Player is attacked, they can choose to perform a Dodge to evade taking damage from an incoming or group of incoming Attack(s).

Players start all encounters with non-Boss Monsters first; Boss Fights however must be rolled with (d20 + Player Level) vs (d20 + (World Number x 5)) to determine an Initiative Order against a Boss; all non-Boss Monsters go after Players.

When a player chooses their Offensive and Defensive Action, Players can discuss who can act first with their Attacks, cycling through every player before passing on the Turn to the Monsters who collectively perform simple attacks if within range.

When preparing an attack, Players can choose one of the following Offensive Actions:
- Primary Skill - Use the Monster's Primary attacking Skill
- Secondary Skill - Use the Monster's Secondary Skill
- Invader Evasive Skill - Manipulate the Invader within you to use their Evasive Skill to your benefit
- Invader Utility Skill - Manipulate the Invader within you to use their Utility Skill to your benefit
- Activate Equipment - Activate your attached Equipment for its effect(s)
- Vore Action - Alternative to other Offensive Actions, used to consume 1 or more creatures for voracious benefits

When preparing your defence, Players can choose one of the following Defensive Actions:
- Balanced Stance - A balanced approach to combat, the Player gains no benefit or downside to fighting as such.
- Aggressive Stance - A heads-on approach to combat, the player lowers the difficulty of landing an attack with their Offensive Action by 1 Category in exchange for raising the difficulty of evading attacks with their Dodge by 1 Category.
- Evasive Stance - A more elusive style of combat, the player raises the difficulty of landing an attack with their Offensive Action by 1 Category in exchange for lowering the difficulty of evading attacks with their Dodge by 1 category.
- Total Defence Stance - Unlike Evasive Defence, under the believed perception that they'll be taking damage from an attack no matter what, the user stands completely stationary and refuses to budge a single step, reducing any damage taken down by 50% while negating any knockback taken.

When all Players have finished performing their Attack Actions, all Monsters engage upon their own Attack Actions without performing a Defensive Action; during this, depending upon the Player's Stance, they can perform a Dodge Action to see how many attacks they can evade
# Vore Mechanic
As an alternative Offensive Action, Players can choose one of the following Vore Actions to perform (It should be clear that these are pred-centric options, but Players can):
- Devour - 
- Forceful Feeding - 
- Yeeting Feeding - 
- Healing Devour -  
- Forceful Release - 
- Yeeting Release - 
- Quick Release -
