*Something's changed. The powers that be that reside upon Petrichor V have changed itself once more; its beasts grow more intelligent, their tactics becoming less static, and some...well...their intentions are...less than pure. They seem to have grown ravenous- hungering- desiring more than just the urge to defeat the intruders that fall and teleport across their homes. Some are luck, most not so, but those that do survive these encounters gradually awaken to power unlike anything they've ever experienced before.*

*In these encounters, lucky Monsters from the planet have lucked their way into devouring an unsuspecting/unlucky Invader to their planet of Petrichor V; depending where and when they are able to devour them is up to a GM's design, but these creatures now gifted with an experience they'd never want to let go of, must now balance sustaining their own lives and the new ones they carry to continue growing in power to satisfy their growing greed. Let's hope that the power has gone to their stomachs and hasn't gone just to their heads.*

*Death's no longer permanent to either side; the Invaders transfer their consciousness to new clones after each death and return from the sky; the Monsters return to non-existence to revive before being brought back to this reality to attack those who invade upon the realm; just what'll both sides do to exploit this fact?*

Starting out, Players have already eaten or are in the process of lucking themselves into eating an Invader; what happens afterwards is a constant spiral of threat and survival where they must protect themselves and their occupant and try to survive as long as possible, become part of an on-going story that they must journey themselves through to its end or their up and coming deaths.

Note: For those who don't do Digestion, alternate rulings can be made where instead of Digestion, it's Energy Drain with the occupant becoming Knocked Out instead, teleporting them back to their ship upon defeat.
# How does the game work?
These rules can be played normally as though one were playing Risk of Rain 2 as one of the many playable characters normally in the game viewed as Classes within this system, but with the intention behind the rules, Players are given the Opportunity to play as Monsters instead who've devoured one of these Characters/Classes labelled as Invaders, and forcefully living in Symbiosis with them until something extraordinary happens, or one of the two parties ends up perishing or being teleported away before death becomes permanent- if that's even possible anymore within the radius of this planet and its many Environments.

It's intended that Players either:
- Play Solo, with 1 DM, or as a full party
- Play as a full party of Monsters, Invaders, or a mixture of the two under certain circumstances
- Run this game either as a Campaign, a Roleplay System Addition, a Roguelike Tabletop game for quick or on-going sessions, or be used as a basis for Risk of Rain Writing
If you're looking for:
- An alternate playstyle such as a Prey benefitting a Pred
- More open creativity with home brew Items, Invaders, and Monsters
- Even more alternate playstyles such as Mounted, Driving, Summoning, etc.
- An overwhelming amount of math/a modest amount of math with semi-fast-paced gameplay
Then check the Outline for the Additional Rules, Homebrew Content, and 
## General Basics
### Invaders
They have the following Stats normally:
Invader HP
Invader Level
Invader Experience
Size
# Stats to keep track of
**Monster HP** - Starts at Monster HP; each Level Up increases Monster Base HP by static amount
**Invader(s) HP** - Always starts at chosen Invader's HP; each Level Up increases HP by +10, is the source of HP Regeneration for the Player-Monster, and must be up-kept with either items or healing effects in order for the Monster to benefit from Health Regeneration from them.
**Monster Level & Experience** - Basic System to show Player-Monster growth; your basic level and stat blocks
**Invader Level & Experience** - Necessary metric to determine your Invader(s) later ability for survival within your guts- not that'll help them escape you in any way once inside; their experience gain correlates from the gold-count you have left before each teleport
**Size Category** - Your size determines your effectiveness at hitting single or multiple targets with your attacks (Depending on the attack used), how hard or easy it is to hit you, and the dice you roll to determine your ability to evade damage from other Monsters/Invaders
**Hit DC** - How difficult it is to hit your Character; usually determined with one or a combination of Game Difficulty, Size, and Creature Speed, with the given number needing to be met or overcome by a creature's Attack Roll for a Hit to landed.
**Evolution** - The evolutionary-state of your Monster should it have the ability to Evolve into a more powerful form
**Stomach Capacity** - Determined by your size, evolutionary state, and Level, determines how many occupants you can keep within yourself to benefit from health regeneration
**Invader Digestion/Energy Drain Rate** - Starts at 1 Damage per-round, increasing by +1 per level multiple of 10
##  Levelling up
All Creatures start at Level 1, and gradually gain Experience (EXP) by performing some form of action:
- Killing Mobs and defeating Bosses
- Successfully opening containers
- Succeeding Skill Checks
- Using the Teleporter while still holding onto Money (Money to EXP 1-to-1 conversion)
Once a Creature reaches an Experience Cap, they gain the following:
- +1 Level
- +Max HP per-Level on Stat Block
- Heals Player up to full HP & Cures Status Conditions
- +BD per-Level on Stat Block (Base Damage)
- +1 Stomach Capacity on Stat Block
Each Experience Cap per-level starts at 100, then it's multiplied by exponents of 1.55 rounded to the nearest whole number for each Level after it (I.e. 100 x 1.55¹/²/³/etc. = 155 (Level 2)/240 (Level 3)/372 (Level 4)/etc.). You can look for the explained examples of each Experience Cap in the Extras and Stuff section.
## How to calculate "Base Damage" & "Total Damage"
When determining a creature's Base Damage for attacks and items, use the following: (Creature BD + 1 per level + 1/2/3/5 per Weapon Item Bonus) x Buffs
Total Damage gains additional benefits like this: (Creature BD + 1 per level + 1/2/3/5 per Weapon Item Bonus) x Buffs x Damage Bonuses x Crit
## Dissection of certain stats and mechanic functions (Mostly for GM's sake)
- Stats
	- Attack Speed - Increases the user's Attack Roll per-stack; each time a Stack-Bonus is reached, usually referenced as reaching multiples of an item-number, the user gains either an additional Offensive Action or converting that Offensive Action into a bigger Bonus for Attack Rolls. You can use any number of Offensive Actions during your Turn, with the rest of the Actions becoming an additional Attack Bonus.
	- Movement Speed - Increases the user's Dodge Roll per-stack; each time a Stack-Bonus is reached, usually referenced as reaching multiples of an item-number, the user gains either a forgo other benefits for their Dodge bonus, a Sprint Speed Buff (+25% per stack), or a Search Bonus. You can't benefit from a Sprint Speed Buff and Search Bonus simultaneously.
	- Sprint Speed - Sprinting Doubles your Movement Speed, also improving your Dodge Bonus by the same amount, but in exchange disables the user's ability to use all Skills and Offensive Actions unless the ability states the ability to do so; in exchange for 1 Offensive Action, the user can use the Tactical Retreat Manoeuvre to instantly start Sprinting to run away from combat.
		- Dodge Bonus - A constantly active bonus for an actively-engaged fighter; a must for anyone attempting to avoid taking damage from threats. Many things grant it, but some things can reduce it or take it away; if you're left stuck in the air with no ability to fly, jump out of the way, or an inability to Move, your Dodge Bonus is completely negated, and in some cases, turn attacks into guaranteed hits.
	- Stack Bonus - When you have enough stacks of an item, you can get a Stack Bonus; depending on the Stat that gives the Bonus, it can give different benefits such as: Additional Offensive Actions, Sprint Speed Buff, or Search Bonus. Attack Speed gives an Offensive Stack Bonus while Movement Speed gives a Defensive Stack Bonus.
	- Armour - Reduces Contact Damage taken if an Attack doesn't exceed the Player's Base Hit DC; for each point of Armour, it increases the Base Hit DC of the Player before Dodge Bonuses are applied. When an attack would hit and deal damage to the Player, and the attack would only be Targeting the Base Hit DC, if it meets but doesn't exceed the DC, roll a d50; the result reduces the amount of damage taken by 50-99%, down to a minimum of 1; if the attack would exceed the Hit DC, roll a d50 for a reduction result of 0-49%, down to a minimum of 1.
	- Health Regeneration - At the start of each creature's Turn in a Round, they gain HP equal to the Base HP Regen; negated by Malachite (anti-heal Debuff), outside of combat the HP Regen is applied each second instead of every Turn (6 seconds) of combat, while in-combat they can only heal at the start of their Turn.
	- Critical Strikes - A chance to increase your total damage by double the output. Effects like Healing, Buffs, and Debuffs do not benefit from Crits.
	- Weapon Item Bonus - For each Item the Player has collected that's considered a Weapon, increase the Base Damage the user deals by 1/2/3/5 per item and stack based on the rarity of the Item itself.
	- Hit DC - The number that determines what number needs to be rolled to meet and land a Hit on a Target to deal damage.
- Conditions
	- Burn - Creatures suffering the Burn Condition are set on fire for 2 Turns, causing creatures to take a Unique DOT that does not stack upon itself.
	- Launched - Creatures affected by this Condition are lifted into the air 3m (10ft).
	- Stunned - For the duration of the Condition, the creature is unable to act at all unless they are immune to the Condition, stopping all movement from the creature while also making them unable to Attack or Dodge.
	- Malachite - The creature affected by this Debuff gains no benefits from Health Regen or HP Restoration effects.
	- Invisible - This creature is not visible by sight, but can be physically felt if the creature were to move in contact with another, but does not reveal them upon contact. Creatures other than Monsters are able to try and aim an attack in a direction or spot on the battlefield where they believe an Invisible Creature might be to attack them, but Monsters do not try to attack something they cannot see, even if they can feel it. Invisible Creatures can still be hit by AOE/Hit-Scan projectiles if they're either in the way or within the AOE when it deals damage, and can give visual or audible indicators when injured with Skills, but aren't revealed when they take DOT.
- Status Buffs/Debuffs
	- Frenzy: Increases the affected creature's Dodge Bonus by +5 and +2 or a Dodge Bonus of +5 and +1 Offensive Action.
# Campaign Style
When making this system, I had 4 styles of play in mind:
- Traditional Tabletop: In the style of a traditional Tabletop RPG with a story, there's plenty of avenue for encounters- simple or even creative, with a unique flare considering the ever-present threat of spawning monsters (Encounters are determined by the DM, with 'random encounters' being the equivalent to sudden spawns)
- Roleplay-centric: In a more free-form encounter, movement and performance is dictated more by roleplay-style descriptions with damage being depicted with the system (Combat is usually searched for, rather than being chased after by Monsters, giving greater freedom for player-interactions and character building)
- Roguelike: Played like the game, Encounters continue throughout the game gradually with waves of enemies that'll continuously, with 1-minute grace periods to find Monuments, Item Boxes, or Shrines of interest, with the main aim being trying to survive for as long as possible and becoming a powerhouse, or reach one of the many endings normally available in the game (ROR2 but if Tabletop, harder to keep track of, but plays more like a game than an experience)
- Story-Writing Base: Essentially a collection of numbers and details to give both people and players a greater idea of how Monsters, items, and special encounters work in this version of the universe, or closely to the original source material (Not really used as a 1-to-1 comparison for combat or world-interactions, but can be a helpful base for creating ideas for the universe)

# Difficulty "Setting"
For the sake of simplicity and speed, Damage rolls are mostly static, with Attack Rolls and Dodge Rolls being rolled are made with one of the following Dice Systems with the following rules (Note: DC = Difficulty Class i.e. how difficult it is to meet or surpass; you can choose to combine multiple Dice Systems to improve Difficulty if you so wish to add more complexity). The following system is used to dictate how hard it is to hit an enemy:
- General Difficulty Dice System for Attack Rolls (Consistent; might be too simple; either remain a single difficulty, or up to DM's discretion for creativeness)
	- Very Easy/Drizzle (d20, DC 1 only way to fail)
	- Easy/Rainstorm (d20, DC 2)
	- Normal/Monsoon (d20, DC 3)
	- Hard/Eclipse (d20, DC 4)
- Size Difficulty Dice System (Larger creatures are easier to hit than smaller creatures; generally more consistent hit-numbers with greater risks for failure or off-targeting)
	- Huge+/Drizzle (d20, DC 1)
	- Large/Rainstorm (d20, DC 2)
	- Medium/Monsoon (d20, DC 4)
	- Small-/Eclipse (d20, DC 5)
- Speed Difficulty Dice System (Faster creatures are harder to hit than smaller creatures, but due to sizes being a thing, being 'Fast' has a smaller range of DC to compensate)
	- Sluggish (d20, No DC/No Improvement)
	- Very Slow (d20, DC 1)
	- Slow (d20, DC 3)
	- Normal (d20, DC 4)
	- Fast (d20, DC 6)
	- Very Fast (d20,  DC 8)
	- Subsonic (d20, DC 10)

# Playable (generally applicable) Monster Races
Here's a list of Monsters Players can choose to play as during the start of each Run/Game (To find Stat Blocks of Monsters, scroll down to Monster Mobs):
- Beetle
- Clay Templar
- Gip
- Imp
- Jellyfish
- Lemurian
- Lesser Wisp
- Mini Mushrum
- Scorch Worm
- Stone Golem
- Elite Variants of the above Monsters - Being either Tier 1 or 2, you gain a larger pool of HP and deal more damage, in exchange for multiplying each EXP Cap by an equal amount.
	- Tier 1 Elite (Blazing, Glacial, Overloading, Mending, Gilded) - 4x Base HP (Mending 3x, Gilded 6x), 2x Base Damage (Gilded 3x). Unlike other Tier 1 Elites, Gilded Elites only start sppearing from Stage 3 onwards.
	- Tier 2 Elite (Malachite, Celestine, Twisted) - 18x Base HP, 6x Base Damage (Twisted Elites 13x HP, 10x Base Damage). Tier 2 Elites only appear after Stage 5.
	- Lunar (Perfected) - 2x HP, 2x Base Damage. Can't be crossed with any other Elites.
	- Void (Voidtouched) - 1.5x HP, 0.7x Base Damage. Reserved for Monsters spawned by void Seeds or infested by a Void Infestor.
	- Honor (Modified versions of Blazing, Glacial, Overloading, and Mending) - 2.5x HP (Mending 1.5x), 1.5x Base Damage. Only spawnable under the effects of the Artifact of Honor.
# Out-of-Combat Exploration
When not in combat, Players must pay close attention to their surroundings to find Boxes, Interactables, or Shrines to benefit their assault into each area that they want to steal items from; with the way Campaigns have different settings, the following rulesets can be chosen to more-fit the style of exploration and item-curation the DM wants:
- Item Spawns
	- Traditional Tabletop: To limit Player Progression to a more steady state, and convert the system to a more RPG-like tone, Hordes of enemies or smaller groups of powerful enemies need to be pre-designed for the Campaign ahead of time it's recommended that a minimum of 3-5 items per player be available for collection and addition to a Player's growing arsenal- obviously, randomly rolled with its rarity, but shareable amongst the players in case players have stuff others want and vice versa.
	- Roleplay-centric: Assuming that these groups are 2+ (Between a DM and a player, or more depending on roleplay group-size), short stories are recommended when setting up these encounters; items may or may not matter in the grand scheme of things in a Roleplay-centric setting, but using metrics with the system helps give interactions depth, but being a Roleplay-type setting some rooms for creativity can be made to make items perform a little outside of their intended usages. Either following the Traditional Ruleset, Roguelike Ruleset, or your own Custom Ruleset, I had a bit of a hard time trying to come up with a way to give Roleplay Rulesets their own item/event-rolling.
	- Roguelike: The DM rolls ((1 x Number of Teleport Loops Performed)d12 + (1 per Stage Teleported to, not including Hidden Realms)) to determine the number of available Boxes available in the Map; ((1 x Number of Teleport Loops Performed)d8 + (1 + 1 per Teleport Loops Performed)) to determine the number of available Shrines in the Map; ((1 x Number of Teleport Loops Performed)d4 + (1 + 1 per Teleport Loops Performed)) to determine the number of available Interactables available in the Map.
	- Story-Writing Base: Can choose to follow Roguelike's ruleset Roleplay-centric, or Tabletop- as the effects can differ minutely or greatly to the original content, it's up to the writer to decide on the facts presented to them to help with the story.
- Map Exploration
	- Traditional Tabletop: For random encounters, roll 2 d20s; the first is the type of encounter, and the second is the interactable itself:

	- Story-Writing Base: Do it however the author wishes to lean into it.

# Combat Explained
Combat is split between 2 Actions that can be performed during a Player's turn: Offensive and Defensive Actions, and when the Player is attacked, they can choose to perform a Dodge to evade taking damage from an incoming or group of incoming Attack(s).

Movement can be done before the Offensive Action, between Offensive & Defensive Actions, or after the Defensive Action. As long as the Player has Movement not taken, they can continue multiple times during their Turn. Each unconsumed Movement grants the user +1 Dodge Bonus per 5ft of Movement exchanged, but only if the User has moved at least 5ft this Round.

Players start all encounters with non-Boss Monsters first; Boss Fights however must be rolled with (d20 + Player Level) vs (d20 + (World Number x 5)) to determine an Initiative Order against a Boss; all non-Boss Monsters go after Players.

When a player chooses their Offensive and Defensive Action, Players can discuss who can act first with their Attacks, cycling through every player before passing on the Turn to the Monsters who collectively perform simple attacks if within range.

When preparing an attack, Players can choose one of the following Offensive Actions:
- Primary Skill - Use the Monster's Primary attacking Skill
- Secondary Skill - Use the Monster's Secondary Skill
- Invader Evasive Skill - Manipulate the Invader within you to use their Evasive Skill to your benefit
- Invader Utility Skill - Manipulate the Invader within you to use their Utility Skill to your benefit
- Activate Equipment - Activate your attached Equipment for its effect(s)
- Vore Action - Alternative to other Offensive Actions, used to consume 1 or more creatures for voracious benefits
- Creative Offense - In exchange for lowering your Dodge Roll by 75% and increase any incoming damage by 25%, the Player performs a set of actions within the Round's time limit that are not Skills to perform unique outcomes to deal damage with unique additions permissible by the DM; a Skill Check may or may not be involved when this Action's performed. Damage dealt is based either on Base Damage or Total Damage. You can't take a Creative Defence at the same time with this Skill.

When preparing your defence, Players can choose one of the following Defensive Actions:
- Balanced Stance - A balanced approach to combat, the Player gains no benefit or downside to fighting as such.
- Aggressive Stance - A heads-on approach to combat, the player improves their Attack Roll by 50% while lowering their Dodge Roll by 25%.
- Evasive Stance - A more elusive style of combat, the player raises their Dodge Roll by 50% while lowering their Attack Roll by 25%/
- Total Defence Stance - Unlike Evasive Defence, under the believed perception that they'll be taking damage from an attack no matter what, the user stands completely stationary and refuses to budge a single step, reducing any damage taken down by 50% while negating any knockback taken.
- Tactical Retreat Manoeuvre - Pick your feet up and start making a break-neck dash away from all trouble coming your way, increasing your Dodge Bonus by the amount given from Sprinting, in exchange for ending your Turn early, forgoing the use of your Primary and Secondary Skills for the rest of the Round, and entering Out of Combat Status.
- Creative Defence - In exchange for lowering your Attack Roll by 75% and decreasing any incoming damage by 25%, the Player performs a set of actions within the Round's time limit that are not Skills to perform unique outcomes to grant mobility, defences, and/or protection with unique additions permissible by the DM; a Skill Check may or may not be involved when this Action's performed. If your enemies take damage from your actions, the enemy takes damage from their own attack your efforts converting 50% of the damage they dealt/would've dealt into damage they take boosted by your items. You can't take a Creative Offence at the same time with this Skill.

When all Players have finished performing their Attack Actions, all Monsters engage upon their own Attack Actions without performing a Defensive Action; during this, depending upon the Player's Stance, they can perform a Dodge Action to see how many attacks they can evade.
## Movement
General Movement refers to the Creature's ability to cross across battlefields and environments Horizontally; each Monster and Invader have their own unique Movement stats, some of which can affect their ability to traverse Vertically, so measurements should be kept in mind when an Action is being performed and which abilities are chosen. 

The Average Speed of a Medium-Sized Creature is 30ft unless specified otherwise.

Here's the list of Movement options available to players:
- Normal Movement - Move at your Race's average Move-Speed.
- Sprinting - Move at double your Race's average Move-Speed while disabling any Skills until this Movement has been ended. Certain Skills/Characters/Items interact with Sprinting in various ways which can benefit or change its interaction.
- Flying - An acquired and specific skill, enabling its user to fly in any direction horizontally and vertically, it comes with various skill-levels that affect total Movement achieved by the skill/ability/ While flying, the creature's Hit DC is increased by an amount equal to the skill being displayed, lowered only if the attacker is also flying, but only if the creature's moved at least 5ft in any direction during their turn; the following skill levels are:
	- Untrained - +1 Hit DC, 25% of Average Move-Speed, 15ft of Movement needed to turn 45 Degrees during Movement or come to a stop.
	- Trained - +3 Hit DC, 50% of Average Move-Speed, 10ft of Movement needed to turn 45 Degrees during Movement or come to a stop.
	- Skilled - +5 Hit DC, 100% of Average Move-Speed, 5ft of Movement needed to turn 45 Degrees during Movement or come to a stop.
	- Professional - +6 Hit DC, 150% of Average Move-Speed, no Movement needed to turn 45 Degrees during Movement or come to a stop.
	- Mastered - +7 Hit DC, 200% of Average Move-Speed, Movement is fluid-like and can perform an 'Air Sprint' to move at Double Speed at the requirement of needing 5ft of Movement needed to turn 45 Degrees during Movement or come to a stop.
## Attacking
During Combat, Players will be asked to choose an Offensive Action during their turn. An Offensive Action asks of the Player to perform one of the listed Skills or Actions to attack during their Turn in Combat.
- Primary Skills attack without cooldowns unless specified, and attack at a rate unlike other Skills are capable. Attacks that can attack more than once per-Round gain a -6 penalty to each successive attack attempt after the first (0, -6, -12, -18, etc.).
Commonly, a Skill asks of the Player to roll a d20 dice, with the resulting number being checked against a Target's Hit DC to see if the attack lands, meeting or surpassing the roll to succeed. Some other Skills might require a different dice, or forgo a dice entirely to perform an Attack Roll.
Later, as you continue progressing through your game, enemies seem to grow exponentially more and more difficult to hit as they grow more powerful and nimble. As such, you use your items that you collect over the course of the game to help compensate for dealing more damage and reliably hitting your Target(s).
Some of the ways you can increase your Attack Rolls are:
- Increasing your Attack Speed and using its bonus to increase your Attack Rolls, or risking attacking multiple times over landing confident shots.
- Taking an Aggressive Stance to increase the Attack Roll result by +50% while suffering a penalty to your Dodge Rolls.
### Critical Strikes
Unless a Skill specifies it, a creature's attack does not deal an Critical Strike or Damage. Any Damaging Skill that deals Damage and performs a Critical Strike normally deals Double Damage (+100%), however, certain items can raise the damage output of Critical Strikes, so this should be kept in mind for later calculations.
When attempting to perform a Critical Strike, roll an Attack Roll like normal; for each 5% of Critical Chance you have, you convert that to +1 Crit Chance with a d20 dice. Starting from 20 and going down, if you roll on a number that would enable you to convert your normal Attack Roll into a Critical Strike, if the Attack Roll also succeeds, the Critical Attack is a success and your attack deals boosted damage. Crits only land if the attack does.
## Dodging
Dodging is unique in this game with its double-dice system; the first roll is to determine the overall success or failure of the Dodger's capabilities, with a second d100 roll is made to determine how many attacks they are capable of evading. Players and Invaders both have the ability to Dodge Offensive Actions, while none of the Mobs can. The second dice is always a d100 unless the number of attacking enemies or attacks exceed 100, which instead would make it a d1000.
## Skill Checks
Periodically, depending upon a scenario, a DM can ask a Player to perform a Skill Check; if your Monster can be found on one of these Maps, or if you have a Monster Manual for the Monster you're trying to identify, you gain a +1 to your roll to identify key-features in the area or know about monsters within the current field. The Skill Checks range from the following:
- Lore (First Stage): Knowledge of the places and Monsters found within the first set of stages. 
- Lore (Second Stage): Knowledge of the places and Monsters found within the second set of stages. 
- Lore (Third Stage): Knowledge of the places and Monsters found within the third set of stages. 
- Lore (Fourth Stage): Knowledge of the places and Monsters found within the fourth set of stages. 
- Lore (Fifth Stage):  Knowledge of the places and Monsters found within the fifth set of stages. 
- Lore (Final Stage): Knowledge of the place and Monsters found within the final stage. 
- Lore (Hidden Realms): Knowledge of the places and Monsters found within the hidden set of stages. 
- Traversal (Vertical): The Player's ability to scale Vertical distances effectively.
- Traversal (Horizontal): The Player's ability to scale Horizontal distances effectively.
- Fly (Untrained/Trained/Skilled/Professional/Mastered): The Player's ability to fly in the air. Most Monsters or Invaders don't have the ability to fly or manoeuvre themselves around in the air, but those that do use this skill to different levels of control. If you meet the DC, you fly up to your movement fine with or without penalties or boosts; if you exceed the DC by pre-determined increments, you move faster and better; if you roll below the DC, you move slower and less fluidly.
- Prediction: You ask the DM to help you predict where enemies pop up, where a creature is attacking from, planned tactics with allies to act in a particular manner, and more; can be used in tandem to perform distant attacks based upon projectile travel-time.
- Hints & Tips: The Player rolls to receive either vague, clear, or non-harmful knowledge that the DM is willing to provide in relation to a puzzle, how close to death a creature is upon appearances, environmental knowledge that isn't described by the Lore skills.
# Vore Mechanic
As an alternative Offensive Action, Players can choose one of the following Vore Actions to perform (It should be clear that these are pred-centric options, but Players can):
- Devour - Depending upon your size, grab a number of creatures up to the designated limit and try to swallow them.
- Forceful Feeding - Depending upon your size, grab a number of creatures up to the designated limit and forcefully feed them to another nearby creature; unwilling preds take damage.
- Yeeting Feeding - Depending upon your size, grab a number of creatures up to the designated limit and throw them at a distant creature to forcefully feed them; unwilling preds take damage.
- Healing Devour - Attempt to devour a target to heal them instead of dealing damage to them, with the option to keep mouth open for reduced Dodge Bonus to keep allies benefitting from allied healing effects.
- Forceful Release - Akin to a Melee attack, the user strongly ejects 1 or multiple creatures out from inside them into an area around them, dealing damage at the same time.
- Yeeting Release - Akin to a Ranged Projectile attack, the user strongly ejects 1 or multiple creatures out from inside of them in a direction, dealing damage at the same time.
- Quick Release - Quickly release an ally, unit, or creature somewhere around you.
- Risky Devouring Guard (Friendly Fire) - Taking a risk attempting to devour a projectile attack and redirect it to everyone inside you; failing guarantees you taking the damage.
