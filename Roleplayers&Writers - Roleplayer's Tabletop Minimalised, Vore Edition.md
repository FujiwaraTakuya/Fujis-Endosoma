Dice System: d6

Dice Rolls come with 2 Categories: Tests & Difficulty
When performing Tests, a player is asked to roll a number of d6 dice equal to the ease/proficiency one has at a certain task; they come with the following ratings:
	- Disadvantage (Roll 1d6)
	- Standard (Roll (2d6))
	- Advantage (Roll 3d6)
Difficulty scales off the ability to succeed a d6 roll; they come with the following ratings:
	- Easy (Success on 2-6)
	- Normal (Success on 3-6)
	- Tricky (Success on 4-6)
	- Hard (Success on 5-6)
	- Stressing (Success on 6 only)
In total, DMs will ask of players to "Roll me a Disadvantage/Standard/Advantage Test at Easy/Normal/Tricky/Hard/Stressing Difficulty"; Crits and Crit Fails can be optional for extra risk and rewards but are normally not used unless a DM desires it; most rolls will be at Standard and Normal Difficulty



Core System: Minimalist and Simple

Performing Actions and knowing your health in this game is extremely simple. Even Experience.
A Player's Health starts out at 5HP. Creature/enemy HP can vary based on encounter and DM choosing. When a Creature/Enemy's HP reaches 0, they're incapacitated but not dead, awake but unable to fight back; if a Player chooses to, they can attempt an Advantage Test at Easy to attempt to KO them or Coup de Grace (kill) them. HP can be increased 1 per 5 XP spent on it.

Actions performable by a character can either be asked if they can be performed, or if they require specification they can be converted into Actions on your Character Sheet; simple actions like climbing a ladder or holding a pet in your arms doesn't need to be written down, where as stuff like using a bo staff to climb a wall or vault a gap, phasing out of reality to another one for a few moments, or even fanning the hammer on a single-action revolver can be written as an Action performable by your character and given a valid statistic with how it can perform. Actions will always deal 1 Damage per-hit, with unique effects also only dealing 1 Damage for the duration of the effect.
To know what Actions you can perform in the game, write a list of special actions your character can perform, then show the DM; the DM will take the Action if it's applicable and convert it into an Action with stats; while each DM will have specific ideals for what is acceptable for an interaction, God-Modding and OP bs will not be tolerated.
Damage dealt for specific Attacks, Status Conditions/Effects, and Actions can be increased by 1 per 100 XP spent on it.

Experience Gain is usually pretty simple; here are some good examples of ways to gain 1 XP during gameplay:
	- 1 Creature
	- Succeed at a Test requiring Speciality in a task (Like lockpicking, acrobatics, diplomacy, etc.)
	- Creative world-interaction (Not memes)
	- Positive participation
	- Repeating Repeatable Tasks (Cooking specific foods, performing specific Working Outs (not routines), Sparring, etc.)
XP amounts can change depending on the difficulty of the task, but finishing Quests/ usually net a decent amount of XP. Make sure to make a checklist for XP as the first time you perform a Repeatable Task, you gain +4 additional XP for doing the task successfully.


Inventory Rules
Either they're weightless, they're summoned on command from a pocket dimension, given weight only in specific circumstances, or someone else writes rules for them.


Vore Rules
Devouring an ally still takes an Action but can be done without a check unless something like a Grapple from an enemy is preventing it, or something similar.
To vore someone non-consentually, you must be Grappling a creature still after Grappling them the previous Round of Combat; voring comes in 2 phases: Nom and Ingest. Performing Vore activates each phase consecutively, Nom then Ingest, where you'll roll a Test based on DM conceived difficulty; if you fail the Ingest phase, your turn Ends and you can only attempt to continue the Ingest Action during the next Round.
Creatures in a Nom can use their turn to Escape the Nom or perform any other Action they can in the Nom in hopes they don't succeed with their Ingest. When a Creature's been Ingested, they end up inside of their predator and take 1 Damage from the Impact, then 1 Damage at the end of every one of their turns. Creatures can choose to perform Actions they know of, or attempt to escape with a Test.
Preds that have consumed a Creature and still have a Creature inside of them on the Rounds after can choose whether or not to digest whatever/whoever's inside them, but can't be selective about it unless they have the ability to. Healing insides are only possible if the Pred has the ability, had healing casted upon them, or if they drank/eating a healing potion/item.
